You're in the living room this time, but the horrible look on mom's face is the same no matter which way you play it. Her bottom eyelids swell with tears as her mouth hangs open.
"How?" Her voice cracks.
It hasn't gotten easier. You're pretty sure someone's wringing the air from your lungs.
"It was an accident. We snuck out to do an orbital walk. We were just messing around and his suit ripped. I tried to patch the leak, but he couldn't breathe. We were too far away from the airlock. I couldn't save him."
This time she sinks to her knees and screams.
Your vision blurs as you stand over her. You don't know what to do, what to say.
This is all your fault.
The door slides open and you quickly end the program. Mom walks into the empty holoroom with a smile on her face, until she sees yours.
"Hey, what's the matter? Where's your brother?"
You swallow hard.

My hand lingers in my pocket, fingertips contemplating the burden of coins.
Do it. One more go. You've got plenty of cash.
My kids' pocket money. Cynth told me not to forget it.
Go on. They won't miss it. What do kids need money for? You buy them everything they need, anyway. One more game.
I should go now. Time to pick Simon and Josie up from school.
Let your wife do that.
She's at work.
Doesn't she finish early on Friday?
She goes shopping. Starts the dinner while I'm out.
Order in. Let her get the kids. Play the game.

How long have I spent playing this video game? Never progressing beyond the first level. Always losing my Sanity points, defeated by the nightmares in that digitized house.
But maybe...
I thumb the pennies, staring at the coin slot in the black wood casing of the games console. A coin slot in a video game console...
You know the kids won't miss the money.
I turn away, almost run away, snatch my car key from the tarnished metal hook by the front door. I press my hand to the scanner plate, hear the electronic buzz and click of the door lock.
But I don't push the door open fully. I turn, look at the screen.
Insert coins for more Sanity.
You can have one more go.
My watch says 3:30p.m.
Go on. One more.
If I didn't have the kids....
Outside. Escaped. But even now, if I shut my eyes, I see the words humming white and eerie in the semi-darkness. So I open them and see a plastic ball-head Cheshire Cat impaled on my car aerial. One of Cynth's jokes?
Go back inside. Forget everything else. You didn't even turn the TV off, that's how much you want to play.
I get in the car--quick. Doesn't take long to reach the school, collect the kids and I endure their usual pokes and prods and moaning at each other and me.
"She hit me" and "Tell him to stop"--the words sound robotic after the umpteenth repetition.
You could turn the car round. Exit here. You'll be home in no time. Just you and the game.
But I've got the kids. Sure, Simon's got karate for a couple of hours later, but after that....
"Simon?"
I catch a glimpse of him in the rear-view mirror, staring, mouth hanging open--and his eyes... Jeez, what's up with his eyes? They're completely white. I pull over, sharp, onto the curb and get out and yank the rear door open.
"What's wrong? Simon?" Tapping his face, cheek not turning red. "Hey, buddy."
My heart's pounding.
You need to relax. Chill out. Play a game.
I punch the emergency number into my phone.
Wasting your time. You don't even have kids, do you?
What?
But you have the game...
Can't get a signal. When I look back in the car, Josie's the same as Simon. But Simon's changed position. Still rigid, but he's moved: arms outstretched, palms face up in freakish supplication. Both kids wear the smiles of wicked clowns.
"Oh shit oh shit snap out of it," I say, as if they're playing a trick on me.
The hospital isn't far, but when I get there the kids have vanished. Seats are empty, and they aren't curled up in the footwell like vacant husks.
See? You don't have children. But you do have the game.
I head home. Calm. As if this is normal--nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. Why?
Before I go indoors, I don't check to see if the kids have reappeared. But I do look at the Cheshire Cat, still grinning sardonically from his aerial viewpoint.
Your car doesn't really have an external aerial. It never did.
But it does. Mine does...
I turn back to the front door, place my hand on the palm scanner. Wasn't there a time doors required keys, like the car? Didn't I have a door with a keyhole?
The mechanism whirrs then clicks and I push and I'm inside. First thing I see is the screen, glaring at me in the dim afternoon light.
Insert coins for more Sanity.
It's 5:26p.m. Where's Cynth? She's usually home now.
Don't worry. Play the game.
I must call Cynth, find out if she's held up in traffic.
You don't think she'll ask how the kids are?
Oh shit. The kids. I need to find them.
Relax. That was a joke. You don't have kids, remember? You don't have a wife, either. But you've got the game.
I do have a wife. I had kids. I remember. Every Friday, Cynth would make dinner and after dinner I'd take Simon to karate class. Same routine every week. And I--
You play video games.
Insert coins for more Sanity.
I never did. I had a job. Did I lose it?
So, shit happens. Stop fretting. Don't analyze. Have fun, play the game.
But it isn't fun. The demons catch me. Sanity points reduced to zero. Game over. Repeat and repeat.
One more go. You will escape.
Insert coins for more Sanity.
Escape... I think I did. I bailed out on my family. Why?
I remember a room with a chair and computer equipment, like a lucid dream. Someone putting a helmet on me. God, I can feel something right now--feels like needles embedded in my temples.
Tentacles burrowing into your brain. Escape the monster. Only one way out. You know what to do.
Insert coins for more Sanity.
I dig into my pockets for the money I was supposed to give... Who? Never mind. I reach into my pockets and pull out--
A handful of dull metal pieces, shaped like teeth. Where's my money?
The white text blinks and blinks and curls up like a crescent-moon smile:

â€œm not sure, Doctor. I want to be fully open with you, but I am afraid of how this is going to make me look." In fact, the man speaking looked terrible. He was maybe fifty years old, shoulders slightly stooped, with a receding hairline, but one could be forgiven for thinking he was older, the way his hands were shaking as he clasped them in front of him. Across the table was a meticulously dressed woman in her forties, hair pulled back in a bun and a look of tempered concern on her face. She held a small notebook, open to a page already a quarter full of handwritten notes. "You are worried I might think you're... crazy, Mr. Hollis? Don't be. There is no 'crazy' here. Only problems to be dealt with. Yours may be comparatively minor. Believe me, I've heard it all." "Call me Kurtis. And no offense, Dr. Tennant, but strike one. You haven't heard this." His eyes were gazing restlessly out the window at the parking lot. "Well, there's only one way to find out, Kurtis." The doctor paused and let the silence stretch. Kurtis Hollis' face showed a tense internal struggle, but finally he spoke. "I've started to have blackouts and... and hallucinations." He glanced furtively at the doctor and then back out the window. "The first was a week ago. At work. Since then, there have been two more. They seem to be getting more frequent and more... urgent. That's why I made this rush appointment." "Are the blackouts and the hallucinations separate events?" "No, Doctor. I blackout--specifically, I see a field of gray static--and then I'm lying on a flat surface looking up at a white ceiling with some sort of ring-shaped light fixture. And I hear an artificial-sounding female voice speaking to me." "Mm-hm," said the doctor, making a short note in her book. "And what is the voice saying?" "It starts out the same each time. It says... it says 'Code red, Captain Hollis. Code red. Assistance needed on the bridge.' I try to sit up, but I can't move at all." Dr. Tennant waited to see if Kurtis was going to continue. When he didn't, she prompted, "I see. And then what?" "The first time? Nothing. I closed my eyes and sort of willed it away, and after a moment of gray static I woke up back at my desk. Seemingly no time had passed at all. I was staring at the same document on my computer screen. Needless to say, I was very freaked out. I had to have my secretary cancel an afternoon meeting, and then I went home." The doctor now had a furrowed brow and was writing quite a lot in her notebook. "And how long was it before the next time?" "That first time was last Monday. It happened next on Thursday morning. I was shaving and my wife was in the bathroom as well --at her sink getting ready for work." "And you had the hallucination while you were shaving?" "Yes. This time the voice started out the same: 'Code red, Captain Hollis. Code red. Assistance needed on the bridge.' Then it said 'Malfunction in suspension pod. Initiating revival protocol.' And then... and then...." "Then what, Kurtis?" "And then it shocked me! I mean the table I was on. It shocked me enough to make me buckle!" This time the doctor let the silence stretch as she wrote extensively in her notebook. She turned the page and wrote some more. "Still think there's no 'crazy' here, Doc? 'Cause I still couldn't make myself move. When I willed myself to wake up this time, I was back in my bathroom. I turned to my wife and said, 'Captain to bridge--state nature of emergency.'" "Really...?" "Yup! And believe me, Doc, that is not the kind of thing that can be brushed off as normal! At least not by my wife. Caroline just about jumped out of her slippers. She said my tone scared her half to death." "Your tone?" "Yeah. She said it was loud and authoritative. Scary." "Yes. That does sound unnerving." "So... anyway... the last time was a doozy. It was this past Saturday, and I was at a company softball game. I claimed a leg injury to sit it out. I didn't want to have another episode and get hit in the face with the ball." Kurtis tried to smile and failed. "So, it was the fifth inning when I suddenly got the gray static again. After that, the voice said the stuff about an emergency on the bridge and then, 'Captain Hollis of the interplanetary ship Allegiant, your cryo-suspension pod has malfunctioned. You are stuck in an extended simulation narrative. Take all possible measures to exit sim.'" The doctor looked concerned. "Let me ask you at this point, Kurtis, do you have a history of mental illness in your family? I'm not ready to make a pronouncement yet, but if there is any record of paranoid schizophrenia in your extended family it might have relevance here." "I... I'm not really sure, Doctor. I mean I can't really remember too much about my family right this moment. "Is that unusual? The reason I ask is because...." But just then, Kurtis stopped seeing the doctor and saw only gray static. In a moment he was lying prone on a flat surface looking up at a ring-shaped light fixture. A disembodied female voice said "Code red, Captain Hollis. Code red. Assistance needed on the bridge. Situation on the Allegiant is dire. Take all possible measures to exit simulation mode." Then, just as quickly, he passed gray static and was with Dr. Tennant again. "Mr. Hollis? Kurtis? Are you ok? I think I lost you for a second there." "It's ok, Doctor," Kurtis replied slowly. I think I know what to do now." Closing his eyes, he said in a firm, experienced voice, "This is Captain Hollis. Exit Sim."





This has been the most difficult commission of my career. I've been to corners of the dark web I didn't know existed and talked to people running identity protection software that messed up my system for days. But I did it. I found the only licensed digital reproduction of Van Gogh's The Starry Night on the entire Virtual Reality Network and I sold it to Victor for an eye-watering price that I definitely earned.
"It probably would have been easier to find the real thing, hey?" he jokes as our avatars stand next to each other in his digital apartment, admiring the bunch of pixels I've spent the last two months of my life tracking down.
I laugh. "Yeah," I tell him. "Probably."
He transfers my fee and we make awkward small talk while I wait for the number in my account to update. Then we say goodbye and I log off, thinking if I never see his avatar again it'll be too soon.
I do enjoy the surprise on his animated face in the second before I go offline though. Most people never bother these days, so it must be a novelty for him to watch my avatar wink out of existence.
I tell people the walls of my digital house are so sparse because I sell all the good art to other people. The truth is, it's because I'm old fashioned. I still like to spend my cryptocurrency in the real world.
I have filled my real home with things only I will ever see.
And Victor was right, the real thing was so much easier to find.

It had been two years since Zhen Dao had seen the sky.
Her family had leased her to one of Beijing's biggest gold farms when she was eight. Every day she would rise at dawn (she knew it was early for she always woke to a cockerel's cry from beyond the thin walls of the dormitory) get dressed in standard coveralls, eat a thin tasteless gruel in a bare mess hall, then head to the shop floor.
The place was always dim, the only light coming from the flatscreens that occupied the dozens of evenly spaced desks. It was neither too hot nor too cold, and the air never smelt of sweaty bodies even though kids like her spent their whole day there. Sometimes her mind played tricks on her, and she imagined strange sights in the corners. Dï¿½jï¿½ vu was common.
Zhen wanted not for food or drink or warmth, but she did miss the clouds--and her family, of course.
She glanced up from her screen, eyes blurred, the first dull pulse of another headache coming. She'd been playing the MMORPG Angolan Fields for a few weeks now, and the gentle browns and greens of the African landscape was starting to make her go loopy. Over the last two years, Zhen had excelled at her work, and the assignments she was given these days were very particular.
One client needed his cartographer character to chart--without detection--a rival guild's diamond mines on the outskirts of Luanda. Another needed to attain native competency in the Bantu language. Neither task was easy, and mistakes were costly: every failed assignment cost her half a day's wages, not to mention's Mr. Lau's cold anger.
The thought of her boss made her eye wander over to his office. It sat on one side of the shop floor, horizontal blinds hiding its innards, but Zhen knew there was a lightweight wooden door on its other side. As far as she knew, it was the only way into and out of the factory, to the--
"Always dreaming of the sky," said Gao, the boy to her left, shaking his head.
"What was it like?" Zhen whispered. A couple of months back, Gao had got beyond the wooden door during a failed escape attempt.
"Don't do it, Zhen."
"Why?" It wasn't as if she wanted to escape--her family needed the money she earned. She just wanted a peek at the real sky.
"Just don't do it."
Gao would never say anything more on the subject, and today was no exception. He used to be a practical joker--changing her hotkeys when she went for a break, writing silly messages in the screensaver--but something changed in him that day. Now he was always quiet and sullen.
"I'm taking a pee," she said, hibernating her character. "Don't mess with my game."
She didn't mean it. She missed the old Gao, hoped she'd find signs of his mischief when she got back.
Passing Mr. Lao's office, she noticed he'd left his door open. On the far side, light spilled through the margins of the door that led outside. Maybe it was a sunny day. She tried to remember the feel of sunlight, the sensation of almost looking into the sun, the shape of the clouds, but her mind was full of the pixelated forms.
She slowed up. The kids at the nearby desks were mesmerized by their games. Mr. Lau was nowhere to be seen. She was about to duck in, when she chickened out.
If Mr. Lau's still not around when I come back I'll do it, she told herself.
In the bathroom that never smelt bad, she peed, then washed her hands, all the while hoping she'd find Mr. Lau back in his office when she returned.
She didn't.
Before she chickened out again, she slipped in. At the far door, her small fingers lingered on the handle.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you." It was Mr. Lau. He stood in the doorway to the factory floor, trim and alert. "But it's your choice."
"Am I in trouble?" Zhen asked, her insides curling.
Mr. Lau shook his head. He came in, closed the door.
"Will I lose wages?"
He shook his head again. "Go ahead. You might not like what you find though."
Was this some kind of trick? "I only want--"
"I know."
Zhen twisted the handle, pulled the door open. Brilliant white light blinded her. When her eyes adjusted, she saw. . . nothing. Only whiteness as far as the eye could see.
She didn't understand. There was something monstrous about the emptiness and her breaths came in shallow gulps. Mr. Lau, one hand clamping each shoulder, directed her back into the office. Without a word, he switched on his flatscreen.
On it she saw row upon row of crammed narrow beds, each occupied by a skeletal sleeping child. The view zoomed to one of the beds. Thick wraparound glasses with goggling, insectile lenses, and puffy earpieces dominated the girl's pale face. Data cables looped away from the mask, while clear tubes went to and from her body. She looked familiar.
"You know," Mr. Lau said, "in another life I'm a fat man with bad breath. And you, Zhen, you're wasting your life away."
Time dragged.
Zhen--and the girl--shuddered. "Why?"
"Why anything? Filthy yuan."
Zhen shook her head. "No, why give us a choice? Why have this door?"
Mr. Lau stroked his chin. "Illusions are vital."
Back at her desk, Zhen awoke her character.
She took him outside, then lifted his head to the digital sky.



Erwin stands outside the door of his house/her house and wonders if his wife is home/not home. He has just finished another long day of theoretical discussions about cats and boxes and he just wants to sleep. He knows that whether or not she is there depends on the observation of that morning's event.
In quantum entanglement, if the measurement of one entangled particle is known (clockwise), the other will have an inverse corresponding value (counterclockwise), no matter how far apart they are.
He had an argument with his wife that morning. She told him that he was too entangled in his work, that he had begun to live his life in a state of uncertainty, and that they would both be much happier if he were more certain about his life. "You're both right and wrong," he had said, "depending on the situation."
What if he doesn't go inside the house, he wonders now, staring at the door. The moment he walks inside, he will know if she is there or not.
Erwin opens the door. Instead of looking inside the house, he looks up at the walls. The wallpaper is a vivid fuchsia with ornate swirls and little vases. But it could also be a soft shade of red, covered with the faces of women looking down at him reproachfully. He was never sure which. Of course, it could've been both.
"Is anyone home?" he asks.
Erwin had always liked the Many Worlds Interpretation, because it gave less importance to the act of observation. It would mean that in one version of that day, he could walk into an empty house.
"I'm in here," she says, from somewhere inside.
In Objective Collapse Theory, superpositions are destroyed the moment some objective physical threshold is reached (time, mass, temperature). "I'm in here," is a physical threshold of sound. The possibility of another world in which he could enter the house in silence did little for him now.
"It's been quite a day," he says, which could mean that it was good or bad. He walks down the hallway, thinking about a recent experiment where a beryllium ion has been trapped in a superposed state. But Erwin realized he could never be an ion.
He stands outside the door of their room, hears something inside. If he opens the door, will she be there? There are too many doors and boxes in this world, he thinks.
He slowly opens the door, wanting to postpone the observation for as long as he can.
"I'm sorry about this morning," she says, lying across his bed in a tight-fitting black camisole and a cat-mask.
Even though Erwin can see her, he doesn't know if she is there or not, but he is certain about one thing--he is still alive.





One
First and most importantly, believe you're doing the right thing. Tell yourself this guide will work--tell yourself whatever you need to in order to step into your POD, close the door, hook up, and log into the game. After that, act normal. Wear your avatar like the mask it is.
Just like every other night.

Two
In the server's lobby, keep cool and ping her. Invite her on a raid. Not just any raid, of course. Only the most difficult and exclusive two-player mission will do. Your partner is a platinum-level player, after all. Don't insult her abilities.
Instead, tell her this is the most important fight of your virtual career and yeah, you know things between you guys haven't been great lately, but you can't imagine teaming up with anyone else. Soï¿½ want to kick some alien ass?

Three
Of course she does. That's why she's playing this game. That's why she's still your partner (on the server at least), which kind of puts your life in perspective.
Just accept the damn mission.
The game drops you far from the Boss making you and your partner tromp through a virtual marshland to reach your goal. But the graphics are so real and responsive, your combat boots are actually sinking in the mud while the pesky low-level aliens spawning every hundred feet rustle in the reeds around you. You hear your partner laugh as she takes out those suckers with ease, feel the heat rising off her well-used gun, see her breath mist up as she cracks one of her classic dirty jokes. It's all so lifelike it could be real.
But it's not.
In reality, your partner's sitting in the POD next to you, in the small, shabby apartment you rent together.
In reality, she might as well be a million miles away.

Four
The POD (Personal Optic-Simulation Device) is lightproof, soundproof and optimized for a totally immersive game experience.
But it's not smell proof.
Bake some brownies beforehand. Let them cool on the counter as you play. Let the game look like a bog, but smell like chocolate. Watch her avatar smile that smile that always makes your heart seize up for a second. Before you installed the PODs, your partner used to call movies and brownies, "the perfect date night." Bonus points if the flick had extraterrestrials in it.
But that was before you lost her to the server, of course.

Five
If you want your partner back, it's important to remind her of life before the POD. True, regular life seems bland compared to the vibrant, sprawling landscapes of the game and endless excitement found within.
You get it, really; you love this game, too.
But your partner is not some in-game trophy and she's definitely not a princess in a tower. She's your friend and the love of your life who happens to adore reptiles and the Mets. And between work and the POD, you haven't seen her in weeks.
So, tell her about your day as you fight through the endlessly spawning aliens and up the steps to the final arena. Be sure to include details. (e.g., Wrote another "Steps-To-Winning" article today, which the Internet will probably completely ignore, but at least the bus was on time.) She will give you her trademark sidelong stare that says, "And this is important, why?" But stick with it. You remember who she was before she started wearing her badass avatar for ten plus hours a day.
To you, she was perfect.

Six
Be sure to equip the best gun in the game before you face the Boss. You spent the last three months working your ass off on perfect kill counts to get this sweet piece of weaponry. Now you're going to use it on the biggest, hardest, most aggressive alien in the game.
The battle starts instantly, without the grace of a cut scene. The arena is empty one minute and then there's one giant, pissed off alien in front of you, spewing slime that feels disconcertingly real.
So there you are with your partner, shouting commands and warnings, dodging tentacles, and firing like a lunatic and oh god, do you feel alive. The adrenaline is pounding in your ears to the rhythm of your gunfire as you and your partner beat the monster down, down, down.
It's... surprisingly easy. You may have leveled up too much.
Congratulations. Now, you and your partner are one shot away from being the best players in the game.

Seven
Remember, you're doing this for her. Don't forget that. Don't forget that this isn't real and the last time you caught a glimpse of your partner outside the POD she was a wraith, a sickly shadow of who she once was. The thing is, you both love the game, it's a feat of engineering, but the POD designers didn't think to include safeguards, health monitors, or time limits. There's nothing to stop players from disappearing within.
Remember, this big ass gun--it won't actually kill when you turn it on yourself.
Tell her you love her before you pull the trigger.
Tell her you miss her.
Remind her it's just a game.

Eight
After you die, the POD will be unusually dark and cold. Unhook yourself and step out.
Stand outside your partner's POD. Put a hand on the door handle. Hesitate.
Here's the thing--this guide's a lie. There's no guarantee your partner will change or even forgive you for sabotaging the best raid in the game. You can't make her unhook or eat brownies or do anything she doesn't want to.
All you can do is open the door.





y most treasured memory is not my own. It hangs on my dresser, captured in a stained glass bubble. I bought it for a week's worth of work. It was not an easy find. There are laws in place to prevent people from slapping a memory piece on an infant, so I had to go through the black market. But it was worth it. When I hold it close to my heart, my surroundings blur away. I am small, insignificantly small, held by two warm hands, held close to a warm breast. My mother's voice coos softly in the distance, cooing a name that's mine. It's not mine, but you learn to silence the voice that contradicts the memory. Her lips press against my forehead. I belong here. But I couldn't be like this for long. It was time to work. I rolled out what passes for my bed, straw stolen from a nearby farm since abandoned by its owner stuck reliving his life when his farm was green and bountiful. I sold the old bed for another memory, one of a child passing a football to another. He catches it, falls, and laughs. I swapped the dirty rags I wore for cleaner ones and stumble outside, alcohol on my breath. I walked down the blue road, averting my gaze from the bodies huddled over glass bubbles, their eyes locked onto illusions, their mouths drooling, smiling at what is no longer there. I turned my memory piece on. I snuck into the compound. Shot two guards for the thrill of it, though I felt nothing. Broke another's neck. Pushed a fourth one out the window. Stole the documents. It was a good scene, though a little too similar to the ones I've made before. And of course, it was missing the emotional element, though I tried my best to fake an adrenaline rush after the second guard. The next morning I went downtown to get it developed. "This is good," said Charlie, holding the newly made glass bubble close to his flabby chest. His computer replayed the events of last night. "Really good. I could find a buyer for this in a couple hours. Eight thousand." "Eight thousand?" I said. "Don't be difficult," he said. "Eight thousand is fair." "That's twice as good as last time," I pressed. "It's worth twice as much." Charlie sucked in air though his teeth and rested a hand on his gut. "It's good," said Charlie, "but the feelings are all off. The actions are there, but people want the feeling that goes with them. You know how hard it is to find raw emotion nowadays." "You know how I am with feelings," I said. "You and all the other lost boys," scowled Charlie. "People want emotion more than action. Shoot up a school, but do it with feeling or else what's the point? Psychopathy, vengeance, heroism, vigilantism, people just want to feel something new." "I don't do new," I said. "Then it's time to start," shrugged Charlie. "Eight thousand." "Ten," I said. "Eight," he said. "Nine," I said. "Seven," he said. After I deposited my eight thousand dollars into someone else's bank account I fumbled through the memories I'd stolen. Most were worthless, throwaways that might feature an orgy or haut-cuisine. A few were older ones that were made before people really grasped the appeal of the memory piece, ones where people would "record" themselves doing something instructional like cooking a dinner or fixing a chair. Still, you could feel all the fear and self-doubt that filled the instructors, so it was ironically enjoyable. There was one great memory in the pile, though. I have long slender arms, smooth legs. My hair is around my neck and my head is pressed between two breasts. Her soft lips press against mine. I belong here. The next morning I realized I'd overdone it, and that I needed to relocate. There was a police drone outside my apartment. I shoved as many memories as I can into my pockets and abandoned my apartment. It was inconvenient to leave, but I traveled light. I knew this day would come eventually. That was what Plan B was for. My friend owned a memory editing business with a vacant basement. That is to say, a man who said he was my friend said he owned that business. I spent the night there. My "friend" and I exchanged no words. He likely worked for whoever did this to me. Whoever turned me into passive income. They were just protecting their asset. I left early the next morning and passed a group of teens having a threesome on the street. They didn't even seem that into it--they were doing it for the memory they were going to develop and sell to some creeps. Which was a horrible mistake, of course--it would sell for double if they at least tried to be more engaged. One by one, I scooped up the bubbles from the urchins littering the streets with their presence. They hissed at me as I took it away, then screamed as they realized they could hear their own hiss, their own thoughts. Then I threw them another memory, lower quality, and they held onto that before they could so much as get to their feet. Swap out the low-quality memories for the mysteries that the addicted homeless are holding onto. I did this for about an hour. Swap dinner with the family for dinner alone. Swap the $100 back massage for the half-hearted back rub your ex-lover used to give. The profit margins weren't amazing, but if you did anything long enough you'd get your time's worth. Sometimes you'd even find something exotic. Like what I was holding in my hand. A golden glass bubble of an old woman on her deathbed, surrounded by her friends and family. She'd lived a full life and was ready for death. The satisfaction of a completed life without doing a single thing for it. The jackpot. The motherlode. That's when the bullet whizzed by my head and I knew I'd overstayed my welcome. This was a rival gang's territory. They were probably planning to swap out the urchins' memories in the same way I was just doing. If I could be worried, it wouldn't be about the cops. They're inefficient, slow like the swing of an executioner's axe. It's the other gangs that pumped out killing machines without needing to actually make their members kill a single person. They strapped their recruits into a chair and forced them to experience murder after murder for weeks on end. Not only does it make you numb to the killing, cycling through that many identities at one time makes you numb to yourself. You forget who you are and do just what you're told. The poor kids didn't know what they were getting into, pieces of their memories ripped away and replaced until their identities were carefully crafted to serve the gang. It was a miracle I survived. And then I started to run, but I already knew where this was going. More and more gang members showed up, guns drawn. I took out my suction cups and started climbing a nearby building. I smashed a window and swung-- BAM! And then I was bleeding to death on the floor of some cubicle labyrinth. I said it was a miracle to still be here I'm not. I don't know who I am. I can't remember. My memories were indistinguishable from the memories of others. The ones forced into my brain. The ones that crafted my identity into one that could serve others. The ones that made me deposit my money into someone else's bank account. The ones that caused the old me to die. I was dying and it meant nothing because I didn't know who it was that was dying. It meant nothing because I died a long time ago. I'de been a walking corpse for so long. Part of me knew coming down this way would get me killed. Part of me wanted this. They did this to me, the people at the bank, or maybe it was the office, or maybe the government. I couldn't remember. All I could remember is that once I had memories of belonging, of a childhood. Now my memories of belonging instead fill my pockets, I wasn't even scared. Fear kicks in when you have something to lose. Blood pools around me and I hold the golden bubble to my chest. I am an old woman staring at my daughter. My husband is holding my hand and tears stream down his wrinkled face but he's smiling and kisses me. Then I look out the window and see my grandchildren playing in a bright green field, the sun catching their eyes just right. Satisfaction wells in my chest, so much satisfaction that the pain of death seems like a distant buzz in a cloud of love. I belong here. I belonged here. BAM!

Sally patted her grandmother's shoulder. "It's time to go."
"I don't want to. I can still be useful."
Sally's grip tightened. "Now, Grandma, we've discussed this. It's the best option."
Her grandmother fixed Sally with her sharp eyes. "I always said I didn't want to go to a home. Trust you to have found something worse." She shook her head. "I was looking forward to watching my great-granddaughter grow up, giving her advice, the way I did you."
"You can. That's the beauty of it. My daughter, and her daughter, and on and on. You'll make a great Download Doll."





It was supposed to be a vacation. That was how it started anyway. Like most first timers, I had some concerns. I had heard all the nightmare stories. People plugging into the sim and never coming out. At least not until their savings dried up and they were pulled out by force. So, for my first sim I kept things simple. I went back to right after my college graduation and this time took the job in Denver over the local offer. It seemed like a safe change, one that wouldn't alter my life in any way I couldn't accept. How wrong I was about that. The first time I met you was on our ninth anniversary. You were a stranger to me, and yet you weren't. I remembered our first kiss outside your apartment, and how we laughed when you stumbled trying to saunter backwards up the stairs. I remembered getting lost on our way to that concert at Red Rocks, and how you smiled and told me to roll the windows down so we could listen to the music echo over the sandstone peaks. I remembered our first visit to your parents, and how you carved our names into the old oak tree in their backyard. I remembered how you laughed when I pointed out the crossed-out names of your childhood boyfriends adorning the opposite side of the trunk. I pulled myself out of the sim a day and a half earlier than planned. The Quantacomp techs advised me to try a different scenario. With an aching heart, I went back in, this time with a smaller change. In my junior year of college, I opted to take the solo biking trio across Ireland that I had always dreamed of and never attempted. Lo and behold I met you on the second day of that trip, traveling with your sister in a Backroads Bicycle Tours group. I pulled myself out of the sim the moment I saw your face. For my third scenario the life change was surgical. On my first day of high school, I closed the backyard gate before catching the bus, preventing my dog Dexter from going missing. When I jumped forward to the present, you and I were together again. This time, we had met in a park while I was visiting my parents in the fall of '27. I had been taking an ailing Dex for one of his last long walks, you had been having lunch in between seminars of the American Medical Association conference. I tried so many alternate scenarios that I eventually lost count. No matter the change, no matter how small, you were there, and I was there, and we ended up together. I left the two-day session feeling exhausted and hollow inside. As part of my vacation package, Quantacomp included a single object from one of the scenarios, replicated to perfection, as a "souvenir" of my time in the sim. I chose the watch you gave me on the Christmas of '29. It was a simple leather band, with a simple wooden watch face, and an engraving on the back that read: "I would find you in any lifetime." I was lying on the couch in my apartment, staring at that engraving, when it finally hit me. You were real. you were out there. We were like two lines, hurtling towards each other, destined to intersect. We had missed some much of our life together in this lifetime, but we didn't have to miss any more. I didn't waste any time looking you up on the web. My heart sunk when I found you. The obituary said it had been a car accident. It had happened last year, and I didn't even know it, I didn't even know you. My life savings bought me months with you in the sim. I jumped around our lives in a hundred different scenarios, trying to experience everything we could have been with what little time I had. When a notification popped up informing me that I only had hours left, I jumped back to our wedding day. When I reached the end of our first dance, I asked the band to play our song again. Everyone laughed at that, but you didn't laugh. You just smiled and held me close as we started to dance.





Now if we, like those characters in recent movies, discovered specific clues in the world around us suggesting that we do in fact live in a simulation, we would of course consider those clues carefully to see what they say about how we should live our lives. --Robin Hanson Listen. We're fairly certain it's true. The laws of the universe just don't make sense the way they should and it's more and more apparent with every atom of gold we run through the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and every electron we smash up at the Large Hadron Collider that we are living in a universe especially constructed for us. And, since we all know infinities cannot be constructed, we must conclude that our universe has been simulated. It's likely that this surprises you. It might even make you short of breath for a moment or two, but don't worry. Your worry itself is proof that you're sentient. The dualists and physicalists were both wrong; you don't need a brain to make a mind. You are proof of that. So is your mother. So is your dog-walker. So is the first girl you ever kissed. So is everyone you know. Or, more precisely, everyone you think you know. Everything you think and feel is real, even though it isn't. It's only natural that you'd like to keep on with your simulated living, as would we. To that end we've devised some rules and would ask for your compliance for the mutual benefit of all involved. First, don't talk about it. Of course it's difficult and we can't blame you for being tempted, but this is rule number one for a reason. Discussing the simulation with your friends and neighbors, or even noticing out loud the glitches in the program seems like an easy way to get your memory wiped down and rebooted. It's also possible that enough people catching on at once will result in our simulation being shut down completely. For these reasons, we've disguised this document as a piece of fiction that will appear in an online magazine and ask that, as much as possible, you behave like that's what you're reading. Feel free to casually pass this article to a friend or acquaintance, but remember, you mustn't discuss it with too much weight. Second, be interesting. This is absolutely paramount. We must all do whatever we can to be as entertaining as possible. Ladies, it wouldn't kill you to have breakfast in your underwear one day a week. Men, more fights with your mothers-in-law, please. Teenagers, think piercings piercings piercings. If you need to see the devastating effects of a boring simulation, look no further that the recent disasters that have been plaguing our planet. Things like earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis are likely all at the hands of programmers. There are only so many times you can watch a man get up, get dressed, and get to work unabated before your curser starts wandering toward File > Tools > Events & Disasters > New Disaster. The government, in turn, will continue doing its part to make sure our simulation is an interesting one. We've installed some truly incapable politicians in high-powered jobs across the nation to ensure maximum outrage. Additionally, we've been collaborating with foreign governments to get moving on several international wars that we think will offer prime opportunities for stories of heroism and betrayal and, of course, lots and lots of action. The loss of "life" will be kept as low as possible, but rest assured that your brave soldiers know that their sacrifice is not in vain. Next, do what you can to preserve processing power. There is always the unfortunate possibility that our simulation will grow too cumbersome for the host servers to handle. Ours is an incredibly detailed program and when you think about how much computer power it takes to generate even a single sentient being (approximately 100 million million operations per second), the idea of simulating our entire universe for the last fifteen billion years or so is truly mind-boggling. We don't know what kind of technology our simulators are working with, but we can safely assume their processing power isn't unlimited. Luckily, there are some things you can do to help. Most important, perhaps, is for us all to do what we can to limit population growth while still having enough sexual encounters to keep the simulation interesting. Maybe a single child is enough for you and your partner, especially considering your child isn't real anyway. Try to ignore the big eyes and soft skin and think of her instead as miles and miles of computer code etched in silicone somewhere far away. That sweet dimpled smile? 01100101000010110010001. In order to last even this long, the program is likely to be taking some shortcuts. For instance, the stars from your exact position on the globe are probably only generated when you look up at them. Thus, you can help by avoiding things like looking up at the stars. Keeping your sock drawer and closet door closed also helps, as it is significantly easier to generate the faï¿½ade of a tightly closed dresser than to have to simulate everything inside it. Try to keep frequently visited spaces, like your car and office, free of clutter. We will also be staging more events like the BP oil spill to keep people away from beaches for certain lengths of time to give the program a break from generating all those billions and billions of molecules of water. Finally, be kind to one another. It seems very likely that sitting back and watching a program run is only interesting for so long. The next logical step is for someone from the host world to insert him or herself into our world. Most likely, there are hundreds of thousands of them here, if not more. Since we're all being simulated by the same computer, there's simply no way of telling them from us. We need to make sure these folks are having a nice time here in our universe. Save your drama for people you've known since birth. When you meet a new person, kindness is key. This means no bullying, no betrayal, and we seriously need to cool it on the random acts of violence. Think of our planet as a hospitality town, or even a resort. We all need to be good hosts now. Our universe depends on it.


Sitting on the fence between dreams and reality, Annie peered into the swirling storm of other people's nighttime imaginations, looking for her mother, who had died eleven years earlier. Sometimes they managed to connect in dreams, although Annie wasn't sure if it was Real Mom or a Mom from her imagination. Annie hadn't asked Dream Mom questions Annie didn't know answers to and Real Mom might. She had enjoyed her encounters with Dream Mom, who was free of the dementia that had claimed Real Mom's last six years. Sharp, sometimes cutting, always opinionated and bossy, Dream Mom had given her good advice about moving into the retirement community of manufactured homes on the edge of a small lake. Annie lived in a house free of history now, clean of memories of the abusive husband who had made her life so difficult. Here in her new home, she reconnected with all the artistic pursuits Morton had beaten out of her. She was painting watercolors again, and gathering with musicians on her back patio. And she had found someone to love. Carola squeezed her hand. Annie remembered what she wanted to do tonight. "Mom?" she called into the maelstrom of spinning dream fragments--a train rolling across an arctic landscape being pursued by a shambling creature; bunnies driving a chariot pulled by chickens and lizards; a cafe full of creatures who weren't human--"Mom?" "Use your heart string," Carola whispered from reality, and Annie remembered what Carola had told her about delving into the dreamlands and beyond, to where death took people. Carola said a cord stretched from Annie's heart to everyone she had loved and lost. She touched her chest and stared out into the populated wilderness until she saw a red thread stretching from her heart into the dreams. She closed her hand around the thread and tugged on it. "Mom." Dream Mom rode a brown-and-white pinto pony out of the midst of the dreams. "Annie," she said, and slid off the horse's back. "Thanks, Dawn Treader." Mom stroked the horse's face, then pulled an apple out of a pocket of her colorful muumuu and fed it to the horse. "Daughter, are you all right?" "Yes, I'm lovely. Mom, is that really you?" Mom laughed the full-throated laugh Annie hadn't heard in years. It had only happened once a year or so, when Mom could rise from her misery and enjoy something wholly. Annie's heart warmed. "It's me enough," Mom said. "How can I help?" "Mom." Annie tugged on Carola's hand, pulling her astral self to the fence. "This is Carola. Yesterday I proposed to her, and she said yes." "How wonderful!" said Mom. She kissed Carola. "Congratulations, Annie. Happiness at last." Annie smiled through her tears. This couldn't be Real Mom. Real Mom wouldn't have been happy about Annie's choice. Maybe Real Enough Mom was better.




I don't understand. All I did was fix her. All my life--since before I can remember!--you've been telling me to take care of Emmy, and I have! I do! Better than anyone. I always make sure she's got food and I take her everywhere I go and make sure she's ok. She almost NEVER gets hurt when I'm watching her, and ok, there was that one time, but that wasn't my fault! She just stuck her hand in the maker--how was I supposed to know she'd do something like that? Everyone knows you're not supposed to--it says so right on the front! Besides, her fingers grew back fine. That's her problem; she's always poking at things. Every time I watch her, half the time I'm pulling her back from poking her finger in something. Like the maker, or the TV. I don't know why you're mad. I take the best care of her, in the history, of like EVER. I even let her play my games! Look at her right now! That's MY game she's in. That's where I got the idea--from games. She could poke and play around as much as she wanted without hurting herself. Or messing up the fridge. And when she was playing, I could play with her. It was great! Only, she wouldn't stay. She'd get bored and wander off while we were playing and if I didn't notice right way you'd come and get mad at me when it wasn't my fault at all! Look, I've fixed her! She's safe and happy, and won't wander off anymore. Now it's really easy to take care of her! I did a good thing. When I asked her why she wandered off she'd just say "not real" and drool or bite something or some other stupid baby thing. So I thought--what if it was realer? And I know we're broke so I didn't even TRY to ask for a new console, even though it would have solved EVERYTHING and it turns out we didn't even have to spend any money. There's this guy on the internet and I know how freaked out you get about it but he's really cool and he built this machine that lets you LIVE in your games! And it's free! All I had to do was download a CAD for the maker and put it together, which was hard, but there was a really good YouTube video about it and I did it on the first try! About the maker feed--I know it was expensive and I promise, I'll pay you back. I already have MOST of the money to do so, because I'm responsible, like you said. If I wasn't I'd have just left her alone and played video games. But yeah, you just put together the machine and plug it in, and it downloads something, and then you have to make a little cut on your neck for the wires, but I was SUPER careful, and look! It worked! You can see her in there, Dad. Doesn't she look happy?
