Sitting on the fence between dreams and reality, Annie peered into the swirling storm of other people's nighttime imaginations, looking for her mother, who had died eleven years earlier. Sometimes they managed to connect in dreams, although Annie wasn't sure if it was Real Mom or a Mom from her imagination.
Annie hadn't asked Dream Mom questions Annie didn't know answers to and Real Mom might. She had enjoyed her encounters with Dream Mom, who was free of the dementia that had claimed Real Mom's last six years. Sharp, sometimes cutting, always opinionated and bossy, Dream Mom had given her good advice about moving into the retirement community of manufactured homes on the edge of a small lake. Annie lived in a house free of history now, clean of memories of the abusive husband who had made her life so difficult. Here in her new home, she reconnected with all the artistic pursuits Morton had beaten out of her. She was painting watercolors again, and gathering with musicians on her back patio.
And she had found someone to love.
Carola squeezed her hand. Annie remembered what she wanted to do tonight. "Mom?" she called into the maelstrom of spinning dream fragments--a train rolling across an arctic landscape being pursued by a shambling creature; bunnies driving a chariot pulled by chickens and lizards; a cafe full of creatures who weren't human--"Mom?"
"Use your heart string," Carola whispered from reality, and Annie remembered what Carola had told her about delving into the dreamlands and beyond, to where death took people. Carola said a cord stretched from Annie's heart to everyone she had loved and lost.
She touched her chest and stared out into the populated wilderness until she saw a red thread stretching from her heart into the dreams. She closed her hand around the thread and tugged on it. "Mom."
Dream Mom rode a brown-and-white pinto pony out of the midst of the dreams. "Annie," she said, and slid off the horse's back. "Thanks, Dawn Treader." Mom stroked the horse's face, then pulled an apple out of a pocket of her colorful muumuu and fed it to the horse. "Daughter, are you all right?"
"Yes, I'm lovely. Mom, is that really you?"
Mom laughed the full-throated laugh Annie hadn't heard in years. It had only happened once a year or so, when Mom could rise from her misery and enjoy something wholly. Annie's heart warmed. "It's me enough," Mom said. "How can I help?"
"Mom." Annie tugged on Carola's hand, pulling her astral self to the fence. "This is Carola. Yesterday I proposed to her, and she said yes."
"How wonderful!" said Mom. She kissed Carola. "Congratulations, Annie. Happiness at last."
Annie smiled through her tears. This couldn't be Real Mom. Real Mom wouldn't have been happy about Annie's choice.
Maybe Real Enough Mom was better.

I don't understand. All I did was fix her. All my life--since before I can remember!--you've been telling me to take care of Emmy, and I have! I do! Better than anyone. I always make sure she's got food and I take her everywhere I go and make sure she's ok. She almost NEVER gets hurt when I'm watching her, and ok, there was that one time, but that wasn't my fault! She just stuck her hand in the maker--how was I supposed to know she'd do something like that? Everyone knows you're not supposed to--it says so right on the front! Besides, her fingers grew back fine. That's her problem; she's always poking at things. Every time I watch her, half the time I'm pulling her back from poking her finger in something. Like the maker, or the TV. I don't know why you're mad. I take the best care of her, in the history, of like EVER. I even let her play my games! Look at her right now! That's MY game she's in. That's where I got the idea--from games. She could poke and play around as much as she wanted without hurting herself. Or messing up the fridge. And when she was playing, I could play with her. It was great! Only, she wouldn't stay. She'd get bored and wander off while we were playing and if I didn't notice right way you'd come and get mad at me when it wasn't my fault at all! Look, I've fixed her! She's safe and happy, and won't wander off anymore. Now it's really easy to take care of her! I did a good thing. When I asked her why she wandered off she'd just say "not real" and drool or bite something or some other stupid baby thing. So I thought--what if it was realer? And I know we're broke so I didn't even TRY to ask for a new console, even though it would have solved EVERYTHING and it turns out we didn't even have to spend any money. There's this guy on the internet and I know how freaked out you get about it but he's really cool and he built this machine that lets you LIVE in your games! And it's free! All I had to do was download a CAD for the maker and put it together, which was hard, but there was a really good YouTube video about it and I did it on the first try! About the maker feed--I know it was expensive and I promise, I'll pay you back. I already have MOST of the money to do so, because I'm responsible, like you said. If I wasn't I'd have just left her alone and played video games. But yeah, you just put together the machine and plug it in, and it downloads something, and then you have to make a little cut on your neck for the wires, but I was SUPER careful, and look! It worked! You can see her in there, Dad. Doesn't she look happy?




From the cavernous walk-in closet, I survey the master bedroom of a person I've never met. Seven-year-old Sadie Jenkins sits by my side, but neither of us are really there. Sadie's mom was murdered in her bed last week, and when patrol officers arrived on the scene, they found Sadie on the floor of the closet sucking her thumb. Fresh out of leads, we need to know if Sadie saw something--anything--but she's blocked it out. The Eyewitness Recall Simulator is a virtual reality program that inserts a witness's memories into the scene in real-time, and anything we capture is admissible in court. As a newly promoted detective, I'd been eager to try the ERS, but what if reliving the crime breaks Sadie? The captain assured me he had faith in my "woman's touch." "I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't the last resort," he'd said. "Nice government scientist lady, a mom to boot, getting offed in her own house is chum for those sharks in the press, and we're out of suspects." Both the bitter co-worker who'd lost out on a promotion and soon-to-be-ex-husband had alibis. Everyone else seemed to like her. No forced entry, nothing missing from the house. This seemed personal--or professional. The simulation recreated everything about the day Cora Jenkins was killed, from the gray skies and gusting winds to the lavender candle flickering on the dresser. I hoped it would be enough to unlock Sadie's memories. "Do you hide in her closet a lot?" I ask. "Sometimes." Sadie twists her dark ponytail. "I like to play dress-up. Mama was napping, so I snuck in. I can be very quiet." "Can you show me what you wore?" She dons a black cashmere V-neck and steps into a pair of red sateen pumps. "Beautiful!" I clap. "Shhh," she whispers. "Mama will wake up." I glance at the bed. Cora Jenkins is in it now. Good. Sadie's remembering. "She won't wake up. She can't. She's not really there." "Like a holo?" Sadie asks. "Yes. And anyone else who comes into the room isn't really there either, so don't be scared." Thunder booms outside. Sadie teeters and falls to the floor. "I don't like storms either." I crouch by her side. "And I'll tell you a secret. I have a hard time balancing in heels, too." "It's not the thunder." Her voice quivers. "The man's coming. He came right after the thunder." I need to keep her calm. "Do you like dolls? Or race cars? I liked Hot Wheels when I was growing up. Watching high-speed car chases made me want to be a cop." "I like cars." "What's your favorite?" "A Porsche like Mama's, but pink." She looks at my hands. "Like your nail polish." A die-cast Porsche appears before us. Bless the techs running the simulation. "Ooh." Sadie beams as she pushes it across the thick, cream-colored carpet. Crisis averted. I exhale slowly. "What happened next?" "Mama mumbled something. I thought she was waking up, so I hid behind a coat." Sadie's hand trembles. "When I looked out again, I saw a man." "Keep moving your car. Back and forth, back and forth." A figure in black appears next to the bed--six feet tall, built like a quarterback--but his face is as plain as a party balloon. I smile at Sadie. "You're doing so well, honey. Concentrate on the car." The Porsche's wheels dig grooves into the carpet. Her breathing normalizes, so I push. "Did he have something in his hand?" "Yes." Her voice shakes as features flicker across his face. "At first I thought he was putting a necklace on her, but then her neck turned red." "Don't look out there, Sadie. Look at me. At me." Her moist, round eyes latch onto mine. "You're a brave girl," I say and steal a glance into the bedroom. The intruder comes into focus: sharp nose, strong jaw, cool blue eyes. Colin Payne. A long-suspected hitman, there was never enough evidence to put him away. As he garrotes Cora Jenkins, my arms tighten like I'm the one pulling the wire. Sadie squeezes her eyes shut. I lay a hand on hers. It feels like such a feeble gesture. "You did great," I say over and over again. Her skin cools and her body stiffens. "Sadie?" I shake her gently, but she doesn't respond. Did I push too hard? She pixelates along with the rest of the room. Moments later, I'm back at the precinct, strapped to a reclining chair and groggy as hell. "Got it," the ERS tech says. Two other officers are there. Sadie is not. "I knew we'd get him eventually," the woman says. The man turns to me. "You'll be going away for a long time." "Me?" I say. My voice is deep. A man's voice. I look down and see thick fingers with hairy knuckles and nails without a hint of polish. "It takes a few minutes to reorient when you've gone through virtual as someone else," the female officer says. "Even for someone like you, Payne." "I'm Payne?" The male officer chuckles. "Your special-ops training served you well. Simply putting you in the simulator didn't work, so we got creative. First, we made you think you were Sadie, but all you did was blubber on the closet floor. Now creating that female cop persona to coddle the child"--he nods at the woman--"that was Officer Caffrey's stroke of genius." Officer Caffrey takes a mock bow, then grows serious. "Now if you tell us who hired you, we might be able to keep you off death row." Memories flood back. A man in an alley handed me a picture of Cora. "Twenty-five G's," I said. He pressed an envelope into my hand. "Cheaper than lawyers and alimony."





Susanna closed her eyes in death and opened them to the glittering, golden streets and pearly gates of Heaven's entrance. There waiting for her were her mother, sister, and grandmother. She knew all along that they would be there. After her initial registration by St. Peter and some paperwork, she rushed into her mother's arms. "So wonderful to see you," Mom said. Susanna remembered how her mom's hugs felt when she was little. She died when Susanna was just fifteen. It was years before she could fully accept her death but it had never altered her faith. It was Stu that did that. Susanna asked the big question she already knew. "Dad?" Her mom shook her head. "He didn't make it." "I knew he wouldn't," Susanna said simply. There never was any doubt in her mind that the man who had abandoned his family when Susanna was five, and didn't even bother to come around when she was granted custody to her grandmother, would not be welcome in paradise. She was glad of it. "Mom, you're wearing your hair different, parted on the other side." Her mom laughed nervously. "I am?" "Why sure, but it doesn't matter. I like it that way." Her grandmother waited patiently. Susanna knew that she would understand that even though she had spent more of her years with her grandmother, there was no one who could take the place of her mother. It was only right that Susanna missed her mother most. But at last Susanna fell into her Grandmother's arms. "Hi Grandma, I sure missed you. I cried for days after I found out you were gone. My grades slipped a bit that semester, but I made up for it." "I know," her grandmother said. "I was watching." "Were you? I always thought that, at least I did for a while." "Yes. Well, we don't need to talk about that, do we?" her grandmother reminded her. Susanna peered deeply into her grandmother's green eyes, but she thought that they were blue. Well, maybe she was mistaken. What does eye color matter anyway? Susanna wished she didn't still have these bitter feelings toward her husband. She thought all that went away after death. Stu, the kind and benevolent pastor, who tossed her aside for another woman. She hoped to God that he'd never make it here. She'd have to avoid whatever section of heaven he was in. Thank God she married Rich the second time around so she didn't hate all men in life. Rich was always kind and patient with her, even through...? What was it she had gone through? Why was she even thinking about Stu or anything else when Anna was standing there smiling at her? Anna, her little sister. She lost her battle with cancer when she was just twenty-four. That was too young. Of course, dying at 35, that was too young also. Susanna had time to prepare herself but that didn't change things. "Anna, you were always so pretty. You still are." Then she did a double take. "Your hair is red. I didn't know people did that in Heaven; changed their hair color." Anna looked strange. In fact, everybody was just a little off. "I think we're going to have to put her back into deep Stasis. She's beginning to realize something is wrong again," Joe said. "Why didn't you remember about the hair color?" Danielle asked the other technicians. "I didn't know all of those little things would really matter. Who remembers side parts and hair color?" Steve asked. Danielle rolled her eyes. "Women do. Now, let's try it again. This time, get your facts straight. She's going to be in this limbo state for a long time and her husband paid for the best experience ever. Heaven on Earth, he said, and that's what we're supposed to be giving her, until the Cure is ready." "Okay, okay, let's roll," Joe said. "Heaven, Take seven." He laughed. "Do you think this time we should have her dog there? Are there dogs in heaven?" Steve asked. "Hmmm, maybe," Danielle said. "At least dogs don't have speaking parts. We don't need word accuracy. Are we ready for Dream Stasis again? Cue the German Shepherd."



It was an aching white blank, with little fissures where code leaked out like drizzling rain, but nobody seemed to notice except Adelaide. "Nina, look," she said at recess, on the squeaking playground swings. "The sky's got a glitch." She kicked out hard, trying to soar high enough to touch the faulty firmament. "Looks fine to me," her friend said, draped stomach-down over her swing, feet shuffling the gravel. Her eyes stuck to the iPhone clutched in her small pink hands. In class, Adelaide couldn't stop looking out the Windex-streaked glass. "It's like someone broke the game," she said, when the teacher scolded her to pay attention. "Life is not a game, Adelaide," he said, raking a strand of black hair behind his white ear. "That's why you should be learning your times tables. Not staring out the window." Adelaide walked home under the void, watching error messages ripple in the wind. She spent the day searching for polygons in the elm trees and invisible walls around the boarded-up well she was supposed to avoid. When she wormed under her sheets that night, the sky outside still hadn't darkened. Adelaide argued for an extension on curfew. "Not a chance," her mother said, leaving a warm kiss on her forehead. "And don't worry. I'm sure the sky will load tomorrow." But when her mother paused in the doorway, Adelaide saw her silhouette jump and flicker, and a glowing trickle of code leak down her cheek.





Cassie's six month contract passed like a fleeting dream, and then she was awake in neural recovery, sipping out of prepackaged cups of water and letting a bot festooned in yellow smiley face stickers check her vision, her balance, her reflexes. The wallscreen across from her showed a blue sky where the puffy white clouds spelled out date and time. She'd gone under in March and now it was August. Her mother was not there to harangue the human doctors and exhaust the administrative AIs, but Cassie had known not to expect her. Not after Cassie arrived home for holidays with fresh gauze scarving her neck, her skin still puffy around the shiny white neural notch that would let a digitized human consciousness sit at the top of her spinal column and inhabit her, move her, be her. Puppet, was the word her mother had gleaned from some Catholic net-tract. My own daughter, a fucking puppet. Cassie tried to explain how the modeling had flamed out again, because she was too short and her ass too big by at least a centimeter. She tried to explain how her then-girlfriend had paid off all her debts from uni in only a year of letting other people wear her body. Cassie wasn't good at explaining while her mother screamed and sloshed Merlot, so she fled out into the chilled evening and then to a bar. Where she met Noel. "You're sure he's not waiting in the wrong wing, or something?" Cassie asked when the nurse came back. She'd rehearsed the words; her tongue still felt foreign in her mouth. "No Noel Pierce scanned in today," he said. "We can call him for you. He might have forgotten." But Noel would not have forgotten. They'd marked off every day of separation on his studio wall, carmine red splatters leading March into August, both of them high on paint fume and love and amphetamines. Today, the most important day, he'd ringed like a target before he ran his red fingers around her neural notch and kissed her hard. The nurse told Cassie she would be staying the night. Six months was a long time to have someone else firing your nerve endings. "Not that long," Cassie said, echoing Noel. "People used to take six months to cross the ocean. And other people would have to wait for them to come back." The nurse gave her a tab of Dozr before he left. She held it static against the roof of her mouth, willing Noel through the door, but eventually it melted anyways and she slept. She dreamed a blur of strangers' faces, most happy, some not. She dreamed retroflash cameras, a gleaming suborbital, Aegean sea and crushed marble sands, mirrors upon mirrors. When Cassie woke up, Noel was standing there. "I'm late," he said. Cassie studied his face, the geometry of his cheekbones, his slate gray eyes and full lips that had entranced her; first in the nightclub fracas, through a whirlwind of vodka, sweat, pheromone sprays; and then in the back of an autocab; and then in the swaying stairwell to his apartment. And then the next day, and the next week, and months, because Noel was not like the other boys or other girls. "I don't care," Cassie said, a familiar helium in her stomach when he put his hand on hers. She grinned. "Aren't you going to fucking kiss me?" Noel bent across the hospital bed but only brushed his lips across hers. Yesterday, when they'd walked into the neural transfer clinic, clutching hands like children, Noel had been unshaven. Now the lines of his jaw were clean. His red thermal had become a black shirt. There was a new swirl of ink on the corner of his collarbone. "I'm late," Noel repeated, lacing his fingers into hers. "I'm sorry." He smiled, but it was stitched on, and Noel did not apologize for being late. Noel thought time was irrelevant. He thought six months was nothing. Cassie remembered: Sitting with their legs wobbling reflections in the empty pool, drinking Cannonballs and watching the starry sky, spinning dreams that seemed close enough to taste the jet fuel. They were going to escape together. So when the contract offer came, courtesy of an aging pop icon eager to be young and beautiful again even if only for six months, Cassie knew it was fate. The money would be enough to go anywhere, do anything. Be anyone, Noel had laughed, tracing the skin around her notch with electric fingertips. But now Noel's eyes were landing everywhere but hers. "You're sorry for what?" Cassie asked. "I'm with someone," Noel said. Cassie stared at the wallscreen where clouds were slowly shifting shape. She swallowed. "But it was yesterday." "I'm sorry, Cass." "Did you even wait a week before you started fucking around?" Noel's face twisted, pained, and it felt brutally sweet if only for a second. "You don't think you were fucking other people?" he asked. Cassie thought back to her dreams, the blurs of faces, under her, over her, skin on her skin. "Don't you dare." "I saw you on a newscast. You were on a yacht with Nicky Bricks." Noel nearly smiled. "I used to listen to him when I was in school. It was. Surreal. Seeing that." "That wasn't me." She looked down and saw her hand still caught in his like a breath he was waiting to release. "You know that wasn't me." "I know. I'm sorry." He stared at their tangled hands. "I met her two months after you left. I started to love her. I didn't mean to love her more than you." "The money," Cassie pleaded, hating herself for saying it. "We could go anywhere." She closed her eyes when he walked away, so she could imagine a shiny white notch at the nape of his neck, slotted with a storage cone, and that it wasn't really him at all, and maybe if she waited here long enough he would be wheeled in to wake up beside her.




"Come on, Bea. I said I was sorry. Can't we just roll back?" Bea is sitting on the couch with one hand clenched between her knees, the other propping up her head. She is staring straight ahead, but her Stream is shielded so Tyus can't tell if she's watching a show or messaging her sister or just staring straight ahead. "We rolled back last week," she says, looking up at him at last. Her eyes are dry but still shot through with pink. Tyus sinks carefully onto the cushion beside her and accesses his FreezeFeel data. "Ten days." "What?" "Ten days ago," Tyus says. "That's not bad. Some people are rolling back every other day, you know?" He worms her hand out from between her knees and holds it in his, rubbing small circles with his thumb. Her skin is cold. "Come on. You can pick the memory." She takes the shield off her Stream and Tyus sees her pulling up their shared FreezeFeel stack. The luminous column of memories extends back to even before they were dating: a 2010s retroparty where everyone brought black plastic slabs and pretended they were phones, an afternoon of bouldering with mutual friends. Then the memories come thick and fast: a rush of electric evenings, sex and dancing and midnight conversations. Lazy morning-afters, watching procedurally generated cartoons stoned in bed, making pancakes with peanut butter and jelly. Tyus tries not to notice how few new ones have appeared in the past three months. The important thing is that the best and brightest FreezeFeel entries are still there, still pristine, and that they are more than archaic audiovisual data. Each one is accompanied by a neural map that will send sparks through the same synapses, trigger the same hormone loops, the same dopamine release. Each one can roll them back to the way they felt right then. For those perfect things that never last long enough: FreezeFeel. Bea takes her time selecting the memory, scrolling up and down the stack, and for the first time Tyus feels the bite of paranoia: maybe she is scrolling slowly to show him that there are more entries on his side than on hers. He knows that, even if he's resisted the urge to count. Then she picks stargazing, from last November, and Tyus can breathe easy. They've used it before. It's one of his personal favorites and lately one of hers, too. "Do it in sync?" Tyus asks. She smiles, nods, both small. "Yeah." Tyus sits back on the couch, still holding her hand, and shuts his eyes. "Three, two, one...." He's back in the memory. It's late November and another hack takes down half the city's power grid; they take advantage of it by ordering a ride up northside, past the stalled-out refineries, all the way out to frozen farmland. Neither of them has ever seen constellations before and Bea is excited for it. She looked up all sorts of things, including how eyes needed a half hour to adjust to the dark, so whenever they see the lights of other cars or autotrucks on the road they cover their eyes and curse and laugh. When they arrive at the Maps-approved viewpoint, they spill out of the car onto hardpacked snow, breathing plumes of steam into the night air. They crunch across the field with thermoses of hot chocolate, exchanging nods with a few other star seekers who braved the cold. He wraps his arms around her from behind; she pushes her numb lips against his cheek. Up in the sky, the constellations bloom bright. "Some of these stars might already be gone," Bea says. "Isn't that wild? They're gone, like, burned out, but we're still seeing them." "Wild," Tyus says, and she pushed her head back against his chest, against his heartbeat. Outside the memory, Tyus realizes he can't feel Bea's hand. Anxiety slices through his recycled happiness and he stops the FreezeFeel. Opens his eyes. Bea is not on the couch. He feels for her Stream on instinct, because maybe she only went to the bathroom, or something, and he sees a long message waiting for him. All he needs to see is the first word: sorry. He can hear her at the door, the small scuffing sounds of her putting her shoes on. He lurches to his feet. If he goes now, if he says the right thing, if they pick the right memory and play it all the way through.... Tyus stands there frozen until the door thuds shut. He sinks slowly back down to the couch and reopens the FreezeFeel. They stamp and shiver in the snow, holding each other tight, heads craned back to see the countless sparking stars, each one a possibility.


The best part of working for the circus is free carousel rides. Each horse bears her into another life. On the black mustang, she works as a marketing executive, whatever that is, in a glittering city of spires. On the roan, she lives by her wits the alleys of that same city. In the pumpkin carriage, everything goes black until she comes back into herself. Maybe she's dead in that one, or maybe she never was born. She descends from the spinning platform on the backs of two strong men, who place her gently inside the mermaid tank, tail first.


1. You need to get to the market, but there are dragons waiting. It's all right; you know how to deal with dragons. You've been thwarting them all your life. You know the rules: don't reveal too much flesh. Don't try to hide. Don't contradict a reptile when it is speaking, but assert yourself early, and often. Smile. Never smile too much, or too widely. Be polite. Be bold. You wish there were fewer dragons in the world, but things are as they are, and you are prepared. You will travel swiftly and in daylight. What will you wear to the market? * If you wear a flowing princess gown, go to 2. * If you choose a practical outfit with sturdy boots, go to 4. * To dress yourself in plate armor, go to 6. 2. You dress in gauze and diamonds; it will ensure you're treated well at the market, and you can get the best prices for your eggs. Your skirt is sparkling, your glittering slippers light, and you love the swish of luxury against your calves. A sparrow sings to you. It does occur to you to wonder if this gown might be too fancy for a dragon to resist. Will it cling to you too pleasingly when it flutters? Will its jewels catch only the light, or unwanted attention? You had better plan a safe route. How will you get to the market? * To take the quiet mountain pass, go to 3. * To take the busy road, go to 5. * To sneak through the caves, go to 7. 3. The mountain path is the best choice. You might have taken the road with your friends, but you've heard there are predators in the crowds. The endless dark of the caverns is no choice, either; there's no one to help you if you encounter trouble. There are fewer dragons here in the forest, since there's little prey for them; it's less likely that you'll be bothered as you make your way through the trees. Above, sunlight glistens through dancing leaves. The breeze is light, and you find yourself humming a little. You walk along, swinging your basket and thinking about your market list. You have a bad feeling, though; there's a whisper on the air that seems like more than branches in the wind. You speed your steps; you hear something scrape through the trees. A wing flaps. A whiff of brimstone drifts. You should have known better than to be walking alone. * You have caught the attention of a dragon. Turn to 8. 4. You choose an easy, practical outfit with sturdy boots. Your vest protects you against the elements, and your breeches have pockets. You are comfortable and prepared; you could cross a fiery death gorge if you had to, and you like the way you look in the mirror. Still, you wonder if the vest might fit you too well; if a dragon's attention falls on you, will these laces highlight the promised meat on your ribs? You had better plan a safe route to the market. * To take the quiet mountain pass, go to 3. * To take the busy road, go to 5. * To sneak through the caves, go to 7. 5. You take the busy road; you know that a dragon is most dangerous if it finds you alone. You might have liked some quieter time with your thoughts, but the mountain pass is uncertain and you don't fancy being alone and vulnerable in the empty darkness of a cavern. You wave hello to your friends and walk the dusty path, swinging your basket. Soon, though--not very far from the market--you have the sneaking suspicion you're being watched. It starts just between your shoulder blades. You turn to call to your friends, but are horrified to see that one has drawn too near, following too close, his new cloak shimmering with a hint of dark scales. You spot reptile eyes. You have walked with this beast for miles. Your friends are laughing at its jokes. Only now, inches behind you, does it reveal the sharp glitter of its fangs. It is too late to cry out; a great, leathery wing has enveloped you, cutting you off from the crowd and pushing you to the roadside. Your feet skid on gravel. You should have known better than to think yourself safe. * You have caught the attention of a dragon. Turn to 8. 6. You gird yourself in armor for best protection, and it is heavy and cumbersome but it makes you feel invincible. You are strong, and the world will know it. Still, you wonder if the light glittering off your steel plate might prove irresistible to a dragon. Would some beast see it as a challenge? You had better plan a safe route to the market. * To take the quiet mountain pass, go to 3. * To take the busy road, go to 5. * To sneak through the caves, go to 7. 7. Everyone knows that dragons have wings; you'll be safe in the caves, where nothing so vast can soar above. You might have preferred the road where your friends are, or the pleasant mountain pass, but you know the cavern will be secure. You light a lantern and carry it through the darkness, and your feet are careful on the stones. You can see the twinkling light ahead, and the final path to the market beyond, when you feel the weight of some hidden stare. You hear a scrape, rough scales against smooth stalagmites, and then something wide and leathery blocks your exit. You should have known better than to take the caves. It's too dark here, and there is no one to hear your screams. * You have caught the attention of a dragon. Turn to 8. 8. You have seen dragons before; they come in many shapes, but they all have razor jaws, sharp fangs, and sinuous lies. This one has colored ridges along its spine, like a dying sunset, and its claws are broken and ragged. You do not trust it. The dragon smiles at you. It has entirely too many teeth. You look frantically left and right, but all you see is wings and darkness; there is no one to help you. Dragon scales smell like ash and disappointment, and they rasp as the beast writhes closer. * Tell the dragon, firmly, that you are not interested: go to 9. * Attack the dragon: go to 10. * Smile at the dragon: go to 11. 9. "Thank you, but no," you inform the dragon. You make sure to set your shoulders back and speak clearly, raising your chin so there is no mistake about your intentions. You know there is no need for violence or false appeasement; if you tell the dragon to go away, it will. The creature rears back, crystalline gaze going wide; its jaw stretches, and its breath reeks of acid disdain. You have made a terrible mistake. The dragon, it turns out, was /only trying to be friendly/. And this is how you respond? Too late, you raise your hands, palms out; you attempt a smile. But the great claws are sweeping downward, and the offended roar is the last thing you hear. * Turn to 12. 10. Your only recourse is attack; you know a dragon will not be dismissed or appeased. But you are prepared for this; you've been taking classes. You make a firm fist, and you keep your thumb tight against the outside. You do not hesitate. When you strike the dragon's scaled nose, the beast rears back, its shriek affronted. You have made a terrible mistake. The dragon is large, and now its hiss smokes like rising frost and the first iron taste of winter. It swipes at your wrist and your blood spurts; your tearing flesh goes numb. The last thing you see is teeth descending. * Turn to 12. 11. There is no point antagonizing the dragon; if you offend it, who knows how it will react? You smile instead, hoping it will leave you alone. You smile until your teeth hurt. The creature's pupils narrow to slits; it slithers forward, and you inch a step back. You have made a terrible mistake. The beast has taken your smile as encouragement; too late, you realize it will see bared teeth as some sort of reptilian invitation. Its wing tip brushes your shoulder and you jerk away, but it's too late: the creature surrounds you, curling in like a python. You are buried beneath the weight of scales. * Turn to 12. 12. You have been eaten by a dragon. You are a fool. You prepared for this day; you were warned. You knew the great beasts roamed unfettered. Consider: what were you wearing? Where were you walking? Did you assert yourself? * Go back to 1. Make better choices.




My father has become panda, my mother elephant. They are altogether out of place in my living room, for all my mother tries to look at ease, gripping a tea bowl in her trunk. It's their third visit since they were uploaded. "Would you care for mung bean cake or more bamboo?" I ask, still too angry to be anything but polite. "Bamboo would be lovely," my father growls. We chat about the weather (warm) and the stock market (volatile) as if we were strangers, and I want to deny that it's really them embodied in animals, but the satisfaction in my father's eyes, the apology in my mother's are unmistakable. Hong Kong is perpetually flooded, half the world hungry, but my parents have outdone themselves, not merely uploading themselves when their own bodies grew decrepit, but ostentatiously selecting endangered species. After an awkward half an hour, they get up to leave. My father bows his head to me, and my anger wobbles or shifts-- I want to hug him, to bury my face in his fur, to tell him I'm glad he came over-- I want to ask my mother's advice about work, to tell her about my girlfriend-- The moment of weakness passes. Keeping my distance, I dip my head fractionally and open the door.




To read the Dear John letter, I had to throw something away. To free up some memory in my apartment. As I slapped one of my bedside lamps into Recycle, I wondered if breaking up had been easier when people had physical bodies. Before we all uploaded ourselves. Before the Simulation's inviolable objects-per-owned-volume policy forced you to get rid of a thing you loved each time you wanted something new. But I didn't want anything new. I only wanted to know why David had left me. An attachment unfolded in front of me when I opened the message: a brass dragonfly, its wings glittering with scores of tiny translucent polygons. Just the sort of thing he knew I would like. Would add to my collection. But where did I get the room for it? The sculpture flew out of my hand, dodging the delicate mobiles and draperies hanging from my ceiling as it flitted over to the corner where David's workbench had been a minute before. I hadn't seen it disappear. David's message was short. "I need space." Too short for the time we had given each other. Rude. I didn't waste the memory on tears, as good as it would have felt to have the little wet gems resolve in my eyes and work their way down my standard-issue face's low texture cheeks. The red circle already hovered over my door, the Simulation's simple notice that I was approaching my memory limit again. But I couldn't throw away any more of my collection. I had already dropped too many of my favorites into Recycle to make room for David's pieces: snowflakes, articulated dolls, a beaded curtain. "Deaccessioning," he had called it. Bastard. I tried to crumple the letter up and toss it into Recycle, to destroy and cast away David's final words to me. But crumpled paper has too many surfaces, and the red circle over my door blinked as soon as I tried. The simulated paper might as well have been steel. I knew where he had gone. David wasn't going to deaccession me without telling me why, no matter how it might look to his new "friend". The wealthy one, who had shown such interest in his talent. A cheap teleport dropped me right in front of the warehouse, the place his friend was letting him borrow. I prepared myself for the embarrassing scene I would have to make to get him to open the door, but the security icon turned green as I approached. Someone had granted me access. A single desk-light glowed in the center of the massive empty room. David sat at his workbench, a new, complicated haircut flopping down around his face as he hunched over some project. He straightened up and looked at me as I approached, but I didn't see whatever emotion was in his eyes. I couldn't look away from the miniature tree sitting in the light in front of him. A bonsai tree. Each leaf fully rendered. Dozens of crooks and bends in the branches. A bed of the smallest pebbles I had ever seen. High-resolution textures over all of it. This single piece already had more polygons than most of my collection combined. More than I could provide for him, even if I put everything I owned in Recycle. And he had just begun. I walked out of the warehouse without a word. David's message had been true--he just needed some space.






It feels strange to me, deep in my stomach, that I can't find my ten-year-old girl in real life--but that, maybe, I can find her here. My hand shakes on the computer mouse as I log in to Second World, using one of the default avatars--a woman with straight blonde hair like a plastic shell and the expressionless face of a crash-test dummy. I try messaging my daughter through the in-game chat window right away, but my message bounces back. I check for her name, "fluttercat," on the online user list, but it's not where it should be between "flutter14" and "flutterkid." My throat constricts with a swallowed sob, but I refuse to believe this tenuous connection to my missing daughter won't pan out. Maybe she's set her status to "hidden." I begin navigating my avatar through the in-game trams from one city to the next, bumping into walls and getting stuck in the occasional corner. Everywhere, I look for Daria's avatar. Yet, I have no real plans until I notice the scribbles of flowers taped to the corner of Daria's monitor and remember her latest Second World obsession. If she's here, I know where she is. I wish I could teleport there, but I haven't unlocked that ability on this avatar. I don't have a personalized avatar, because I don't really play Second World. I know my way around, though, because I've watched over Daria's shoulder more than enough. I take the trams to the right city and head out of town, through the virtual forest. The trees have leaves like fractals, and the sunlight streams down in shafts filled with swirling dust motes. If you watch long enough, you can see the swirling patterns repeat. I've watched my daughter come this way so many times, but I've never followed the path myself. I'm afraid I'll get lost among this forest of clones--each tree clearly sharing the same basic code. Then I see the glade Daria loves open up before me. And there she is. Daria is curled up with her arms around her knees in the middle of a sunny clearing, filled with fantastical flowers drawn by some of the greatest visual artists in Second World. Daria's wearing the most complicated avatar I've seen her in. I know it's just an avatar, but she designed it. And I can see all her pain reflected in the changes that her virtual self has undergone in the past year. To begin with, she was simply a cat. An anthropomorphic feline with pointy ears, whiskers, and a twitchy tail on the body of a little girl. It was funny watching my daughter turn herself into a cat on the computer after all the years she'd spent pretending to be one. Then her dad and I started fighting. After each big fight, I noticed a new feature. When she saw him throw the thermos at me, she added butterfly wings. When he tore the door to the living room off its hinges, she added a mermaid tail. When Ken and I told her we were getting divorced.... That's when she added the tortoise shell. A big green shield covering her avatar's little back. The way her butterfly wings fold up under it always makes me think of a ladybug. Her avatar is painfully cute. And painful. Today, she's added a pearlescent unicorn horn between her kitty ears. And matching spikes all over her shell. "Your dad's gone," I type. Her avatar's mouth starts moving, but a text bubble doesn't pop up on the screen. Belatedly, I remember that the goggles I bought her are wired with a mike. So, I turn up the sound and hear my little girl's voice come out of the computer speakers. Quietly but with a venomous edge, she says: "I won't go with him. I'll never go with him." I told Ken that she didn't want to see him. But, I guess, if Ken had ever listened to me and believed the things I said, we wouldn't be here today. "We called the judge," I type, omitting the part of the afternoon where Ken and I stood on the front step yelling at each other, while Daria's bags sat ready by the door--but no little girl in sight. When Ken got it through his head that I wasn't hiding Daria--I didn't know where our daughter was and I was just as scared by that as him--he stopped calling me names that I cringe to think Daria might have heard. (What if she was hiding in the bushes, listening?) Then, we started looking for her. We called all of her friends, and even her teacher. No one had heard from her. After a few hours driving around, checking the local parks, Ken took it upon himself to call the judge. He thought he'd get Daria for an extra weekend or two, as some sort of punishment to me for not having her ready and waiting for him this time. His plan backfired. "The judge talked to the court counselor," I type, trying hard to keep my hands steady. "The one who talked to you about who you wanted to live with?" Daria's butterfly wings rustle at the edge of her shell. I can't tell if she's nodding. Her avatar's expression is hard to read, but I continue anyway. "They're not going to make you visit your dad on weekends. If you really don't want to, they won't force you." A small part of me feels triumphant that Daria's behavior has won this fight for me. The idea of leaving her alone with Ken almost kept me from divorcing him. But I told myself he wouldn't hurt her. And she was exposed to his yelling anyway. I couldn't protect her from that. I'm still trembling in fear, both from fighting with Ken and worrying about Daria. She's not talking to me, and she could fly away with those butterfly wings or simply log out at any moment. Meanwhile, I keep picturing my baby girl squatting in some gritty, cold, alleyway downtown. Goggles on; attention to the real world off. "Daria?" I type. "Please still be there." Daria's winged-merkitty avatar starts rocking, and her voice pipes through my computer speakers, high pitched and small: "I d-don't have to s-see him?" The spikes on her shell seem shorter, less pointed at the tips. "NO," I type, losing my internet cool and using all caps. My blonde human avatar leans forward and puts her hands out in an animation automatically triggered by the word. "I mean," I type, trying to soften it, "only if you want to." "I don't," she whispers. "Okay," I type. "Where are you? Please tell me so I can come get you." "Just you?" she asks. "Just me." "Well..." Daria says, in the tone that I know means she's embarrassed. The spikes shrink even more; they're pearly nubs, a mere decoration in the shell's pattern now. "I'm at the library," she says. "They have a really nice set up with free wi-fi and super plush chairs. They don't seem to mind if you hang out here all day." I feel like collapsing with relief. I type, "STAY THERE." Then, I run for the door, not even bothering to log out of Second World. I can't wait to lay eyes on my daughter. Yet, as I drive to the library, I realize that, in a sense, I'm already with her. My generic, default avatar is sitting in that field of flowers next to my daughter's complicated one. Maybe, once we get home, Daria can help me start customizing it.



Veterans are most in demand. The rawest memories, brutal and blood-sticky, they're what people want. The movie studio found Josh through the veteran's register, then did research. No friends, no family, an old alcoholic living on disability. His life lost to the pain of the past. They're the ones with the best stories to tell. On the operating table, preparing to receive his anaesthetic, the veteran stares into the doctor's grey-blue eyes, the same color as the sea he ran screaming into in '67, and says, "Biloxi. Let me remember Biloxi, the guys I trained with. Don't let me forget them." His mind floods with memories of poker hands won and lost, night push-ups in the mud, the faces of friends who would later die. He needs a drink. "That's not part of it," the doctor replies. He's only doing his job, the veteran knows that, but it's the blankness in his face, the coldness of those grey-blue eyes. He doesn't care either way. It's all just money to him. "Four of them were tortured in front of me," says the veteran. "Bamboo under the nails, eyelids cut off, but they left them alive. Willians was next and they just sliced him across the throat." He pulls a finger across his neck and makes a noise like shhhup. "Gone." The doctor flicks the end of his needle and watches clear droplets spray out of the end. "Please," the veteran says, "what will they do with my memories?" The doctor smiles with his mouth and his cheeks, but not his eyes. "That's of no real concern to you." "Will I even recognize myself? In the film?" After the war, the veteran became a clam digger, then a salmon fisher, then a shrimper, anything that brought him food and bed, as long as it was by the water. He was a hard worker, but a drinker. His dreams always ended with him running out of the jungle, across the wide yellow sand and into a churning sea that sucked him under, stole the air from his lungs and the life from his body. Upon waking, he wished it had happened that way. The needle poised, the doctor asks, "Anything else before we begin?" "I had an affair with a beautiful girl called Rosie," says the veteran. "A guy in my platoon claimed he could fix the World Series with his mind." He starts to cry. "The first time I saw the Queensboro Bridge after the war it was gleaming and it was sunny, and I was so glad to be home. I wanted that feeling to last, but it didn't." Eventually, the veteran settled in his hometown of Newton and became a barber. He cut kids' hair, mainly. Some color and sets for the older women. Every night, over the swept up piles, he wept and remembered the boys. He drank bourbon, alone. Sometimes he drank all night. Eventually he lost his barbershop. The studios found him in the line at the soup kitchen, greasy grey bowl in hand, a bourbon-soaked beard festooned to his face. "Ready?" asks the doctor. The veteran shoots up, face clenched. "Who will keep their vigil?" He sinks back down, and the doctor injects him. When Josh wakes up he remembers only to the end of his childhood. He has a new sea-view apartment and a bank account with enough money to live on for the rest of his life. He doesn't realize he's an alcoholic, so despite the strange gnawing in his gut he doesn't buy a drink. He wakes up every day with a smile and throws the curtains open to let in the sun, to stare at the sea. Its endless churning means nothing to him now. Josh starts to jog. He feels strong, alive. One morning he stops to chat to a lady straining with an English Bulldog that slobbers over his face when he bends to pet it. They walk for a while, Josh holding the dog with ease. Her name is Gladys. Soon they are meeting every day. Later in the year they go and see a film together called Valley of Ashes. It's about war, atrocities, despair, and pain. Josh is riveted. How he suffered, thinks Josh about the man in the film, the soldier, the hero, who at the end runs into the ocean, screaming, but free. Finally free.





My online friend is writing an essay about the depleting bee population. I look out my bedroom window at the lavender bushes. Fuzzy insects land on dainty purple blossoms. "How come our bees are all alive and thriving?" I ask my parents during homeschool. They exchange a look from opposite ends of the kitchen table. "You shouldn't go near them," Dad says, wringing his hands. "Think of all those terrible stingers," Mom frets. "And oh--what if you're allergic to them, Sara?" I roll my eyes and go back to doodling in the margins of my Math practice sheet. While my parents catnap upstairs after lunch and before History, I sneak out into the backyard. If my parents had it their overprotective, overthinking way, I would never leave the house. Not that there's anything to do out here in the hinterland. Our closest neighbors are still miles and miles away. Or so my parents say. Trimmed grass and vibrant flowerbeds adorn the backyard for the most part. Then, there's the jungle. It grows near the wooden fence at the back of the property, a small thicket of shrubs and bristly vines. I ignore the jungle in favor of the lavender bushes. Their powdery old-lady smell tickles my nostrils. Fat bumblebees flit between the raised spikes and rest on floret clusters. I take out my phone to text Anastasia: How do you know when a thing's real? On top of being my online friend, Anastasia is also my girlfriend. My parents don't know about her. They'd probably say that, because we can't touch each other and exist in the same space together in real life, what we have doesn't count as love. Her reply comes right away--You investigate, silly--along with a string of throbbing heart emoji. Anastasia's a budding environmental scientist, so she knows about these things. I sprawl out on my belly close to the lavender bushes, gathering intel. The bees are too many to count, all of them moving in the same swirling pattern from flower to flower, never once leaving their bushes. When a while passes and nothing changes, I decide a more hands-on approach is in order. I extend my fingers and brace myself for the sting, but the round insects only bump against me, sluggish, dizzy, before resuming their prerecorded path, their too-symmetrical dance. The bees act nothing like Anastasia's paper suggested. I look around my backyard. Equally perfect, equally symmetrical. I stare up at the window. The curtains are drawn; my parents, the fussy computer programmers, are still asleep. So I step into the jungle, the only dissonant note. The spring air ripples, and the thorny branches scratch my arms and legs. I reach out with my fingers, and the world turns technicolor. I'm thrown backward, but not before I peek through the iridescent veil. The afterimage burns behind my eyelids: the real world outside this artificial bubble I've been caught in. My phone pings from where it landed on the grass beside me. Anastasia's impish grin greets me on the cracked screen above her text. Any luck with those bees of yours? My fingers itch the way my skin and heart and brain do, itch with the urge to type: How do I know you're real?
