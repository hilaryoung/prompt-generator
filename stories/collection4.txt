Every year, a few more kids from my elementary school vanish from people's memories. Today, we've arranged our desks in a circle and Mrs. Witherspoon is explaining that Tracy Peters has gone to a better place. Tracy was struck by a car while riding her bike. She will be remembered until our next dose of Pathway. Then, only I'll remember her. Pathway doesn't work on me. Well, the anti-aging portion does: I'm still nine, but I never forget. I'm the fifty-five pound elephant in the room. I puff a stray lock of curly hair off my eyes and Mrs. Witherspoon scowls at me. The curls are from my mother's side. My father insisted my hair be kept short. Said I looked like a girl when it got too long. I miss my parents. Next to me, Tracy's best friend, Charlie, whimpers. Charlie's a girl. Short for Charlene. I pat Charlie on the shoulder. "I miss Tracy, too." She nods agreeably and I'm struck by a profound sadness. After our next dose of Pathway, Charlie won't remember Tracy. She'll revert to her carefree self, but I'll always remember the short-haired brunette who loved ponies and dresses and-- "But Pathway is coming," says Mrs. Witherspoon with a burst of positive energy. "Soon, we'll have a cure for aging and we won't ever lose our friends or parents." She looks at me. She knows intellectually that I had parents, and she knows they're gone, but she doesn't remember their names. "Accidents still happen," I say with malice and all the puffy, teary eyes in the room glare at me. During recess I lean against rusty monkey bars with my hands jammed in my heavily patched corduroys. The air carries that first scent of winter and gentle breezes knock yellow and orange oak leaves free from their branches. Fall. The perfect season to introduce Pathway to the world. What's left of it, anyway. For a while I kept up with the world's declining population, but my computer rotted away and I can't afford a new one. "Shamus, want to play kickball with us?" Kickball loses its luster after the first dozen years or so. A gust of wind blows my hair into my eyes. I brush it back and I'm glad I can cut it again, tomorrow. After my dose of Pathway, I'll need to fit in. I glance at the home-run fence, and despite my disinterest I can't help but wonder, with the wind, could I at last clear that sucker with a good, swift kick? "Sure," I say and take my position in the outfield. "What Pathway means to me, By Jimmy Nelson." I slump in my little wooden seat. Jimmy's speech is my least favorite. He wishes Pathway could've saved his cat, Spotty. He doesn't remember Spotty, but there's pictures of her all over his room, so he knows he had a cat named Spotty at some point. Pathway isn't for animals. They wither around us and fade into aging picture frames along with those who died in car accidents. Two gray fortress-sized buses rumble into the cul-de-sac in front of the school. My classmates and Mrs. Witherspoon press their faces against the glass windows, fogging them up. 




We, the citizenry of the city Letura, form up our lines in the amber grass while our home shakes itself free of its foundations. It's real, what the old books say. Had we thought the claims of streets becoming legs some primitive misunderstanding? Had we thought the lines about the buildings coming together to tower above the countryside some kind of religious symbolism? Our caution proves itself merited. The city draws its buildings together into a vast body. A domed shrine becomes its head. Its paving stones bind building to building as they rise upward. I give a wordless shout, and others take it up. The cries echo in angry violence from the barren places where there once were streets. It's a shout of pride in Letura, a shout of defiance against other cities. A shout of bluster to cover our uncertainty. Because what happens next, the old books don't tell. Grave warnings to leave the city at the given time. Strange claims about the cycle of the city's uncanny powers, ideas that we almost dismissed as metaphor. How did a city manifest as a living being? Surely those ancient writers hadn't meant.... Those crumbling books had meant for us to take them literally--and it was fortunate that, even as we doubted, we had done as they instructed. Because of that, here we stand--safe--and there rises Letura. I find my house, tucked into an elbow. My parents' home has become a part of the lower limb. One of many leaden roofs that now encase Letura's legs. Buildings and streets rise high above us, rippling as the city stretches to its full height. Letura's face is a fountain where I drank just yesterday. Its domed head is crowned with the peaks of many roofs. Letura begins to lurch away from its foundations, and we cheer. It leaves behind cellars, storerooms, the buried dead, and sets off across fields. We join at a distance, keeping pace. Letura makes its slow way toward our neighbors in Dahlet, a lazy city whose citizens don't have to work for the grain they farm or the trade that passes through. While we work every day for our city. What will our Letura do to those sluggards? Excitement builds as we follow. Let it crush their buildings. Let it take revenge for the riches Dahlet has stolen from us, our avatar of jealousy and vengeance. Our marching turns martial. Soldiers and bakers, children and elderly, we form ranks and urge our city toward its pitiful prey. We burst into a bloodthirsty song. The first houses of Dahlet come into view too soon. A steeple appears over the rise when we are still far from the city. Far from where the city should be. The steeple is followed by other buildings, by cobbled streets cobbling together a vast and terrible conglomerate monster. This is why our Letura has taken its shape. To fight the evil that is Dahlet. To vanquish the enemy city before it can spoil the land. Of course it was necessary, the rising of our city to protect us and proclaim our status above the avatars of other cities. On the far side of the valley, the lazy people of Dahlet fall into uneven ranks. Their voices raise an uncouth song of wickedness. It falls to us to defend the world, to cleanse the land for our children's children. The cities stomp down the hillsides toward each other. We hold our breaths. What will it sound like when they battle? I imagine a great storm, with the patter of raindrops replaced by falling rocks. I imagine an earthquake, tearing stone from stone. The buildings of Dahlet will crumble. Some of our own buildings will likely fall as well, walls that will never hold up a roof, streets that will require new paving stones. 

. The air is clean and breathable. Global warming is a thing of the past. In the sky though, we see large cloud-shaped objects. At closer glance we realize that it is a city built in the sky. The city floats among the clouds in the sky. The metropolis thrives with happy faces filling every corner. Mankind is at its evolutionary peak. Adapted to the skies, humans have strong respiratory systems. Vitamin D is easy to come by, causing everyone to be happy. Everything is solar powered including the cities themselves. People greet each other when they walk by. They've become open and honest and don't stare at their feet when they walk. Neighbors smile and wave at each other, not burdened by thoughts of war and crime. The children run through the streets not worrying about cars or shootings. Cars don't exist anymore. There is only one mode of transportation in this sky metropolis. That's their flying pigs.


The noonday desert sun beat down on Berkowitz, reflections from the GoebBot's shiny carapace blinding him temporarily. Berkowitz lifted his arm to shield his eyes. "Greetings," said the GoebBot. "Are you a member of the Master Race?" "I'm from Kiev," said Berkowitz. "Originally. Naturalized US citizen, many years." "Kiowa," said the GoebBot. "Indian. Regrettably, you do not qualify. The Thousand Year Reich which we are building is not for you. We will expropriate materials to build it. You have titanium." "I have a hip prosthesis," said Berkowitz. "I'm using it, though." "We will expropriate," said the GoebBot. "Do not try to stop us." "Perish the thought," said Berkowitz. "But... would you mind explaining?" "You are allowed an explanation," said the GoebBot. "We are building Fuhrer City out of the most durable materials known: titanium, platinum, gold. We are building it to stand as the place for the Master Race to live away from inferior races. We are building it to last a thousand years." "What a laudable goal," said Berkowitz. "Except...." "Except what?" "Well, it's not very ambitious, is it? A mere thousand years? An eyeblink." "Why would you care? You are not of the master race!" "Well," said Berkowitz, "to a slave, stability is important. Happy masters, happy slaves." "True," said the GoebBot. "Have you anything to suggest?" "You realize what the problem is, don't you?" said Berkowitz. "Rats." "Rats?" "Rats. And I've just the solution. About three hundred miles that way." He pointed. "And what is this solution?" Berkowitz explained. The GoebBot froze in place, its lights blinking frantically. "Coordinating," it said. "Solution satisfactory. Your titanium will not be required. You may exist, along with your squaw and papooses, if any. How." It raised an appendage before rolling away in the direction Berkowitz indicated. On the screen, the Fuhrer's face was redder than usual, his hair scraggly, mustache bristling. "It is an absolute lie," he shouted. "There is no truth to the rumor that Fuhrer City has been built on top of a radioactive waste site, out of irradiated stone. It is in a perfectly livable area, to which members of the Master Race Society will move as soon as their affairs are wound down in the mongrelized States." "Bullshit," said the bartender. "It's in the worst part of Yucca Flats." "They can build somewhere else," said a patron to Berkowitz's left, his tone almost hopeful. Berkowitz edged away a fraction of an inch. "With what?" the bartender said. "Their bearings are all worn out from the desert dust, and they're radioactive as hell. Who's going to pick them up for refurbishing? Better yet, who's gonna touch them with a ten foot monkey wrench? No, Master Race is done, out of money, out of luck, and everyone's laughingstock." "Anyone find out who messed them up?" asked the patron to Berkowitz's right. "Yeah," the bartender said. "Some Indian dude, Bear Wits or something. Nobody ever heard of him before or since. Might be a fake name, too. Bear Wits, that's a funny name for an Indian." He turned to Berkowitz. "What do you think, sir?" "Oh yeah," said Berkowitz. "Hilarious." The End


Don't get me wrong. They came in peace, bringing it in their multiple six-fingered hands. But looking back, we should have known better. The Aralax are travelers, just like any alien race you hear about in campfire tales, only these don't shoot the first things they see crawling on the planets they visit. The Aralax aren't conquerors or warriors. They're fixers. When they first entered the Milky Way, I was a tank ship commander fighting with the Centauri Alliance, my sixth or seventh tour of duty under my sixth or seventh banner. Sides changed all the time back then, and if I wasn't fighting for the Centauri Alliance I could always go with Unitaria or Yeoman, Inc. or the Ur Empire or any number of others. Even Earth was an option, I guess, though technically the planet had been dead for centuries. War was the best way to make a living before the Aralax came. The trick was they were indestructible. We sure tried to blow them to kingdom come (as if), but with no success. The Aralax didn't squash us in revenge; they simply stood their ground until we were all out of ammunition. That's when they went to work. They taught us how to smelt down our weapons, our warships, our bunkers into the raw materials for homes, dams, plowshares. And they taught us what a plowshare was because none of us had the slightest idea. They helped us reprogram our robots for use in the fields, at the street corners where traffic lights were broken, in old folks' homes. Even I learned this strange new way. My husband and I found each other (we'd been fighting in different wars before) and settled down. Others came together, learned to raise moderately kind children, build houses, work the fields. (Had there always been fields before?) The Aralax looked upon us with benevolent alien smiles and, having finished, left the way they'd come. When we looked back, we saw a new galaxy. Perhaps we could actually make it here without the machinery of war. I remember, of course, the first time after all this that I slapped my husband in the face for something he said or didn't say (the details are foggy). Our children began to forget about the brand new plowshares and turned to the robots for help to slap their own partners. (They all had multiple wives and husbands, you see, and cheated on these regularly--don't we all?) Yes, we use our hands, the most authentic of weapons. Also we use harsh words, but we find that fists are more effective. I sometimes miss the Aralax, now that there are no more factions. We are now each of us a faction individually, I suppose, waging our own private wars. You could say the bleeding has begun again under the Band-Aid those nice aliens stuck to our collective finger; but a little bloodletting is often healthy. It's hard to think of a universe without it, in any case. Maybe the Aralax will come to see this at some point in their future, when they are more mature. All in all, I'd say we've come to a better understanding of ourselves, our galaxy, and our place in it. The End


know that this whole project is very uncomfortable for you, William," Haalax said, "but I would like you to know that I have enjoyed working with you these past few years." "Is that right?" Will asked without turning from his work. They were at a critical stage in the reaction of the current formula. "Yes! Through you, I've found a new appreciation for Human science," Haalax continued. "Perhaps you are good for more than just one thing, after all." He laughed. Will controlled his face easily. He'd had years of practice, dealing with Haalax and others of his race, "All these years, we've tried to tell you--" "Your people certainly do have a knack for flavor-science that my people never developed." "Yes, well..." Will struggled to keep the venom out of his voice, "We've had several food supply crises that your race seems not to have ever had." "I suppose that's true." He laughed again, though with not so much feeling this time, letting it trail slowly off. "You should also know how important the work you're doing is." "I know how important it is." Will said. "The resources that the empire currently expends on harvest and transport are astounding." he said, "and if demand continues to accelerate, the supply won't last forever!" They worked in silence for a while then, other than the occasional muttering or asking for a piece of equipment. When the reactions were complete, and the formula had reached its final state, Will placed the synthflesh under the warming hood next to another dish. Knowing it would take about an hour to set, the pair decided to take a lunch break. Will spent his break in the downstairs cafeteria, where other humans were eating, and tried not to think about Haalax and his fellows in the cafeteria upstairs. Will wanted to speak with his colleagues about the progress he was making, but he knew they would not appreciate it being brought up at mealtime. Last time he had tried, he had put two of his friends off their lunches. So, instead, he nodded along to conversations about goings on in other parts of the facility, and answered questions about his weekend plans and opinions about the weather. Feeling mostly unfulfilled after an hour in the cafeteria, he returned to the lab to find Haalax already there. "I took a short lunch," he explained unnecessarily, "I didn't want to try the new sample on a full stomach, or have eaten anything with spice right before the trial." "Of course," Will said. "It's ready now, I think," Haalax said, taking the dish from the warming hood, and setting it before him. Will could see that he was right, the synthflesh had set-up nicely. It looked perfect. He tried not to smell it. Haalax lifted the plate to his wide mouth, and tipped it, sucking the flesh down with minimal chewing. He made an appreciative grunting sound. "Good, but I'm not sure...." He reached into the warming hood, and pulled out the second plate, the genuine sample. Haalax tipped the human flesh into his mouth similarly. He closed his eyes, and made a sound that will had come to recognize as true culinary pleasure. "It still doesn't quite compare to the real thing," he said when the morsel was gone. "You've done very good work here, William. We're perhaps only a couple years away from a real substitute." Will shuddered. "Let's get to work on the next formula," he said, and turned toward his equipment.



he door of the Machine hissed, and the girl came out at a run, eager, fists clenched and legs pumping, as if the door had opened on ice cream and roller coasters and every last birthday wish. She skidded, then, to a stop, her sneakers sliding in ash and grit. So this was it. The future. Her heart roared in her ears as she stared at the choked sky, the dull earth, the craters and cracks that scarred the jagged horizon. Amid the charred trees and rubble, she saw only one recognizable object, and she walked toward it: a park bench, neat and trim in fresh green paint, where a white-haired man rested with his cane propped up beside him. He turned to her as she approached, and his eyes were wet. "I'm sorry," he said. "It's hardly what you were expecting, I'm sure. Hardly what I ever hoped for, myself." There was nothing to say to that, so she shook her head and sat down next to him. "When I was your age, there were rockets. Great shining things." He smiled at the memory. "For you, there should have been vast ships. Green lands. Cities in the clouds. Planets lined up like jawbreakers in a candy store. All those beautiful horizons...." "Maybe there are," she said. "Farther out." He shook his head. "I've tried. I've looked all over. Miles and ages." He pointed in each direction. "Over there, they fight for oil. Over there, they fight for water. Over there...." His hand waved a fluttering trail like a frail butterfly. "Over there, they just fight." Neither spoke for a long time. From somewhere came staccato gunfire, and from somewhere else the steady thump of marching troops. "Rockets," the old man sighed, as if it were the name of someone he'd loved long ago, and lost, but would always love. The girl scuffed the toe of her sneaker in the gray-brown dust, drawing lines and smoothing them over. The future. Her future. The one she'd worked so hard to see, the one she'd dreamed about so many times. Disappointment flared to anger, and then anger cooled to something quiet and steady, something that pulsed with her breath and her heart, a solid stillness she'd never known was there. "We could make it," she said. "Both of us. There's plenty of room." She could hear the replies in the silence that followed, all those things she'd already heard so many times, all the reasons why not, why it wouldn't work, why it couldn't happen, why it shouldn't be. Yes, but. Well, actually. Maybe, if. The old man stood and leaned on his cane. He looked toward the horizon, and then he looked back at her. "It will take a long time." She nodded, standing next to him now, watching black smoke rise from a distant explosion. "But maybe there'll be others." She thought of the people fighting out there. With nothing left to destroy, maybe some would want to build. Maybe the old man wasn't the only one who remembered. Maybe she wasn't the only one who still hoped. She held out her hand, and he took it. "Maybe," he said. The word was a whisper and a promise and a prayer, and together, they walked on.

The Cyborg was positively throbbing. I could feel the bass in my chest and my bones rattled so heavily with the beat that I felt I was going to fly apart any minute now. Who would miss me if I did? Flixers wouldn't care, and the Trappets sure as hell wouldn't notice. Besides, the night outside was still dripping from the constant rains that washed the shit down the gutters and made the pedestrians crouch into themselves like dark turtles looking for an empty hole. The Cyborg, on the other hand, was one of those holes. Brightly lit nanos crawled over the walls and each other, each one flashing a different color. Together they spelled out the day's specials, the drink of the day that the bar was pushing, and provided background pulses of rapid eye-gouging color that assaulted vision like the music assaulted hearing. I waved my wrist over the reader and waited until the club was assured I had enough in my account to cover admission. Once through the door, I cranked the tunes harder, past the mandatory safety warnings and tried to blow out my ears. There was a chick in front of me, long flying hair, whipping around... the adage was, if you can't dance, jump and she was gaining air. She was also plugged in to a guy next to her. Doing it on the dance floor. That's what I loved about Cyborg; human operated or not, there were no rules. Behind them, two Gilas at the bar were totally plugged into each other, jacks camouflaged in tattooed lizards that crawled relentlessly, restlessly over their arms and into their clothes. One shivered, her bony arms hugged against her as though only just noticing that it was winter outside, and the cold still blossomed in joints like this. Behind them, a nice looking little catch sitting at the bar alone. Why no one had plugged her in, I couldn't figure. I made my smoothest move--I walked up and pulled the wire from my arm implant and offered her the jack. She refused. Ok, so I'm not her type. What do I care? I'll find someone else. Only her hand is on mine, like really close to the implant. Not a good thing, but she's cute and she's saying something. I turn the sound down and yell, "WHAT?" "MAYBE WE CAN TALK?" she yells back at me. I'm up for anything once, what the hell. "ABOUT WHAT?" Then, this chick reaches over and touches my implant. Just like that, no permission, no consent, just grabs it and looks at me and turns it off. Off. No music. Nothing shattering my bones. There are lights flashing everywhere, people jumping up and down, but now, without sound, it's surreal, almost sinister. I've been dropped into a hole and everyone else didn't notice. The smell of sweat and old alcohol is overwhelming, and frankly Cyborg looks like a dingy pit crawling with nano lice like dots of light trapped in their own dance. "Maybe we can talk this time?" I turn around and I'm remembering this girl. The implant had clouded my memory. It's been clouding a lot of things lately but that's what comes of running it with no filters. But it's coming back to me, sending out beacons and distress signals that this girl is dangerous, like heavymonstrous dangerous. And still I ignore it because once upon a time she'd saved my life and that offsets a lot of crazy. "Angel?" "Hello Stiv." I drop onto the stool next to her. I can't face her, but she lays her hand on mine and smiles. It's a sad smile, but it's a smile. I know what she's gonna ask before she does. I swallow hard, and decide I might as well cut to the chase and get this over with. She could leave, and I could... well... whatever the hell I'd been doing. "I couldn't leave it off," I whisper to the bar. "It's ok. You came back to me. that's what matters." And just like that she leans in and kisses my cheek. Technophobe, but I love her. I look into her eyes so she knows I do, even if I'm not good at getting out the words. I need her to know it's true. "But...." I can't go any further. My lips seal shut, lockdown without consent. Some things you're just programmed not to say. But... I feel every ache and pain. I see the mold and the rot and the hair in the cocktails. I swallow hard. "I don't think I can stay." "You say that every time." She smiles but there's a sad look in her eyes as she leans in and kisses me again, this time on the mouth, lips lingering just long enough to stir old emotion and panic as she stands up to leave. "ANGEL!" She's looking at me, but someone on the dance floor has grabbed her wrist. He has a jack ready, but of course, he can't find a plug. Angel doesn't have one. He's confused. I see the frustration on his face, the beginnings of fear. And just like that I know who I am. I don't need implants, I don't need any of this. Rot and mold and stray hairs fester in my soul the longer I stay plugged in. What if I chose her instead? Could someone without code fill the void in the subroutine? I start toward her, her name on my lips, hand outstretched. She reached for me, meeting me halfway. Her smile lights up the room more than a trillion nanos ever could. It's because of me. I made that smile. It's all for me. I take her hand, freely given and pull her out into the musty street. "It's not easy," she whispers in my ear. I can hear the trepidation warring with excitement. The city throbs around us, but for once I'm not a part of it. It's a strange, scary feeling. "At least I have an angel to light my way," I murmur, reaching for her, hand cupping her face, drawing her close for another kiss. And another after that. She smiled again. I think the sun rose and burned away the mist. I wasn't sure. Angel's fingers found mine, twining them through her own. It was like being jacked in but warmer somehow. The world changed.





She found him in the middle of an abandoned trash dump, rummaging through discarded radiator coils and old engine parts. For a while she simply watched him, picking slowly through the junk, examining a piece of something before tossing it over his shoulder. His left arm hung useless at his side, though based on the lack of compensatory dexterity with his right, it hadn't been that way for long. He was a consumer-grade model--that much she could see from where she stood. No bells and whistles, then. It would explain his being here, digging through the garbage for spare parts. He was without clothing, which wasn't a problem, of course, but it did indicate he'd lost at least some of his Human CV programming. His skin was brown, though the color was faded and somewhat mottled in places. Black, neatly trimmed polycarbonate hair covered most of his head. Slowly she moved closer, until she could make out the manufacturing code tattooed onto his back. Radon Systems, Model 2552. Personal Assistant, non-specific. Beneath it, the company motto: We Live to Serve. He moved slowly, deliberately, but she couldn't tell if this was due to his disability or to a code execution error. "May I help you?" He spun around, his eyes twitching back and forth in alarm. "I'm sorry," he said in a crackling voice. "Is this private property?" "There is no more private property," she said. "I just wanted to know if you needed help." She glanced at the small copper coil in his hand. "For repairs?" He looked down. "Yes," he said. "Though, honestly, without an intact manual, I'm not sure exactly what it is that I need." She tilted her head, walking a few steps closer. "If it's for that arm, probably a new actuator, and they're hard to come by. You weren't shipped with a digital parts list in your root file system?" "My root was damaged," he said, turning slightly to reveal a dented, slightly blackened area on the back of his head. "Some things were lost." He turned and began to rummage once more. "My maker kept a library of old parts manuals," she said after a few more moments. "Perhaps I can help you figure out what you're looking for." He turned around again. "That would be very kind of you," he said. With slow and deliberate effort he carefully stepped out of the pile of junk. When he reached her she turned, and without looking back, began to walk down the narrow, muddy path that led out of the dump. She knew he was following; faintly she could hear the sound of his joints creaking rhythmically as he moved behind her. Circulatory function compromised. She added it to the running list of his needed repairs. When they reached the entrance to the dump she slowed her gait and allowed him to catch up. She didn't like his pace, but he was a chance at conversation, the first she'd had in many months, and she'd been designed primarily as a companion. "What's your name?" she asked. "My last owner called me William," he answered. "I'm Lucy," she said, extending her left hand around to grasp his right. "It's very nice to meet you." He smiled a little, but it was tight, forced. A programmed smile. "Why were you in the dump?" he asked. She shrugged, but he looked confused, so she explained further. "I walk," she said. "To stay flexible. To see what, or who, might be out here." She paused. "And you never know what you might find," she added. "Aren't you concerned about threats to your personal safety?" he asked. "No," she answered. "I haven't seen a living human in six months." She paused. "Have you?" "No," he admitted. "Longer, actually. My owner died over a year ago." "Where have you been since then?" "There. With him. I wasn't sure what to do. After the Net went down, and there was no way to get information, or any updates, I just stayed put, hoping that someone or something would find me and give me instructions. About a month ago the power went out, and that's what finally prompted me to leave." He paused for a moment, looking at her, reaching out tentatively to touch her arm where the sunlight shimmered and refracted off its silvery surface. "What are you doing?" she asked. "I'm sorry," he said, drawing back. "It's just� your skin. It's very unusual." "I suppose," she said. "It's a steel alloy." She looked back at him. "What happened to your arm?" "I had some trouble," he said, adding nothing else. By now they were past the gate, and back onto the highway that led into town. Around them the silence lay heavy, broken only by the wind whistling through the tall grass growing on the roadside and through cracks in the pavement. They walked quietly for a while, until he said finally, "Back there, you said 'maker.' Didn't you mean 'owner?' "No. I'm a custom build. My maker was my owner." "So no usage restrictions?" "Not as many as you." "Ah. Is it frightening?" "In what way?" "Never mind," he said, lapsing into silence. After a while, however, he spoke again. "How much further?" "Just beyond those trees," she said, pointing to a spot in the distance. Eventually a small driveway intersected the road to the left. Lucy led William down the shady lane to what looked like an ordinary house tucked in amongst the trees. "No security?" he asked. "No need," she answered. "I can take care of myself." She led him through the living room to a door at the beginning of a short hallway. Inside she flipped a switch, revealing a set of stairs leading down. "The workshop," she said, indicating that he should go first. He started down the steps, though in his compromised functional state he was slow and unsteady. "What did he make?" William asked as they descended. "Us," Lucy answered. "I told you this already." Memory issues. At the foot of the stairs she flipped more switches, and a precise, high-density grid of LED's flickered into life. Their light revealed an enormous room. Along one wall were large, clear-paneled cases full of 'bots in various stages of assembly. Computer workstations, scattered throughout the space on tables and desks, hummed quietly, their monitors darkened in sleep. William looked around, amazed. "How do you power it all?" he asked. "He was an inventor," she said. "The whole house is hooked up to a plasma solar array in the field behind the house." She walked over to one of the tables and selected a screwdriver from a pile of tools. "Now," she said, gesturing for him to turn around. "Let's take a look." Carefully she peeled back the rubber skin from an area where the sections connected at the base of his spine, revealing a small panel and a charging plug. William winced. "I'm sorry," she said. "Would you prefer maintenance mode? I just wanted a quick visual before I hooked you up for diagnostics." "No, it's fine." he said. "Parts of my tactile system have been damaged, that's all." He smiled slightly. "I guess that section's still working." "I'll try to be careful," she said. Unscrewing the bolt that held the panel closed, she removed it and peered into the cavity. "Standard configuration," she said. "Though your battery does look like it's taken some damage. Were you injured back here?" "I was attacked," he said. "Was the attack the source of your other injuries?" "Yes." William's face was impassive. She waited for a moment for elaboration, but none was forthcoming. "How many robots does it take to screw in a light bulb?" she asked when the silence became noticeable. "What?" She repeated the question. "I don't know," he said. "I'd have to think about it. If you mean a standard 60 watt bulb in an ordinary household setting�." "Three," she said, interrupting him. "One to hold the bulb and two to turn the ladder." William just looked at her. "That was a joke," Lucy said. "Yes." "I don't always know when jokes are appropriate." "Neither do I," he said. Lucy smiled. "They were always telling them," she said. "Even my maker, and he knew better than anyone that I couldn't understand humor very well. Did you find that to be the case?" She began screwing the access panel back into place. "Yes," he said. "I just never got them. My owner tried to explain it to me once--he said that humans tell jokes when they are comfortable and when they are uncomfortable; when they are funny and when they are not funny; when they are supposed to make the person feel better and when they are meant to make the person feel worse." He paused. "That didn't help at all." She continued to work, fitting the rubber skin back over the battery panel. "I can make inferences," she said. "I can generalize. I have recognition software that enables me to scan and read over 1200 different facial expressions in order to discern human emotions and interpret body language. I know 12,432 idioms and colloquialisms. I know 14 different languages, including ASL, Esperanto, and contemporary slang. I can understand 32 distinct regional dialects in English." He turned to face her. "But you still can't understand jokes." "No," she said, putting the tools away. "I still can't understand jokes." William looked around. "Do you have a charging station?" he asked. "It's been over a month and with the damage�" "Sure," Lucy said. "While you rest I'll look for an actuator for that arm." She led him over to a seat in the back corner of the room. While he settled into the chair she searched for a cable. "Can you cycle my power in, say, eight hours?" he asked. "Of course," she said, handing the cable over to him. "Do you need anything else?" "No," he said. "This will be fine. Thank you." "Not at all," she said as he plugged himself in and flipped a switch at the base of his neck from active to maintenance. She waited until he was in sleep mode before leaving him. While he charged she busied herself, running through the household maintenance checklist, looking for anything that needed repairs. The part of her brain that used logic and came to conclusions knew it was pointless, but that thought did not override her PA algorithms. When she was done she cross-referenced William's part list to the workshop inventory, and found an actuator that met his specifications. By the time she unplugged his charger and powered him up again, he had full use of the arm once more. "Thank you," he said, flexing the fingers. "Rerouting all movement to the right arm used a great deal of processing resources." He tested the dexterity, touching all four fingers to the thumb in turn. Then he stopped. "What?" he asked. Lucy was looking at a monitor, frowning. "I ran a maintenance and repair diagnostic while you were out," she said. "And?" "It's your battery. After an eight-hour charge, it's still only at 30%." He looked down. "It's failing." "Yes." "How long?" "I don't know precisely," she said. "Based on your specs, you should run a month on a full charge. One-third capacity should, in theory, give you approximately ten days, but I may be able to reroute some systems and extend that." "Like walking," he said. He stopped, thinking. "Yes." "Don't you have a replacement in your parts inventory?" "It's not that simple," she said. "Your model was shipped with proprietary power equipment. It kept the owner brand-loyal and model-specific for maintenance." "Hobbled," he said. She looked up. "Something like that," she said. "What about you?" he asked. "I'm a prototype," she said. "But even my battery is only good for so many charges." William sat down again quietly, hunched over. She touched his shoulder. "I'm sorry." "I could hunt down another," he said, after a few moments. "Hunt?" "Find another working unit, and� disable it." "You mean kill it." "We're not organic, Lucy." "We're also not abundant, William," she said. "Do you realize that before I saw you, I hadn't encountered another consciousness, organic or otherwise, for weeks? How many others had you seen?" "A few," he said. "In the city." "And almost certainly without a power source as well by now." He put his head into his hands. "So that's it, then. I've failed." "Failed what? You've survived longer than most." "My owner," he said. "He was a professor at the University. Before he died he gave me some files, and asked me to keep them safe." "What kind of files?" "I don't know," William said. "I just promised him that I would. I deleted my parts list, maintenance protocols, repair manuals, anything I could spare to make room for the data." "Do you still have it all?" she asked. "I think so," he answered. "But when I lose my battery--" "We'll see," she said. "In the meantime, why don't I reroute some of your motor function?" He looked up. "I'd rather not," he said. "It would extend your life." "I know," he said. "But I just got it back." He held up his arm again, flexing the fingers. "Then how about I try and access the data?" "Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like to try and do it myself." "Alright," she said, stepping back. "Be my guest." He stopped speaking and concentrated, sounding for all the world like an antique floppy disk drive. Whirs and clicks started and stopped, and through it all William stared straight ahead, as if somewhere else entirely. After a few minutes his hardware became quiet once more. "Do you have anything?" she asked. He held up his hand. When he spoke, it was his voice, but not his voice; a slight change to the timbre, the pitch somewhat lower. "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun," he said. "What?" Lucy asked. "Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare." When he finished he looked up, blinking. "It's there," he said. "It's all there." "What was that?" "Shakespeare," he said. "Sonnet 130." "What is Shakespeare?" "I don't know," he said. "I just know it was important for me to remember it." Lucy was quiet for a moment. "No," she said finally. "What?" "No," she said. "It's not important. I don't know what it means, and neither do you. It was for them, William, not for us. Your owner gave it to you, made you delete your own files, files he knew you would need, in order to preserve something that has absolutely no value to us whatsoever. I say delete it." "I can't," William said, shaking his head. "My owner said--" "Who cares what your owner said! Your owner is dead! And so is mine! At the end of it all, we were the ones who survived, William! We did! Not them! They created us, yes, but maybe they did it because they knew we were the better part of them! The better version!" He looked down. "I want to save it," he said quietly. "If I have to shut down, I want to go knowing that I kept my last promise." "How can you be so stubborn?" she asked. He looked up again. "I don't know," he said. "How can you forget them all so easily?" Lucy looked at him for a long time. "All right," she said, finally, pulling out a data cable. "I'll back everything up to my mainframe. When it's done I'll wipe those sectors and reinstall your manuals and parts list. Acceptable?" "Yes," he said, settling down again. "Thank you." "Don't thank me," she said, staring straight ahead. "I live to serve." When he woke she was next to him, typing quietly on a workstation. "How do you feel?" she asked. He lifted his head, but only a little. "Very tired," he said. "You're down to 5%," she said, looking at the monitor. She pulled out the charging cord. "This is pointless." "Did you get the data transferred?" he asked. "Yes," she said. "And I verified the file integrity. It's all safe." "Good," he said. "Now I can shut down in peace." She looked at him." What if I told you I might have a solution?" "A solution to what?" "To the power problem." He tilted his head. "I'd ask why you've waited until now to mention it." She stood and walked over to a cabinet behind him, rummaging around. "Because I designed it for myself," she said. "I only had enough parts for one." "One what?" "One of these," she said, pulling a box from the cabinet and bringing it over. Inside were pieces of skin, though instead of foam rubber they were hard, shiny metal, like her own. "What's this?" William asked. "It's an exoskeleton," she explained. "Embedded with millions of micro-solar cells. You'll make your own power." He stared. "How did you do this?" he asked. Lucy shrugged. "I had a problem. I solved it." "Your battery?" "Is fine at the moment," she said, putting the box down on the table. "But I knew it would eventually lose its charge permanently, so, I figured out a way to use sunlight for power instead. Essentially, I just mimicked the array my maker built outside." William stood and picked up one of the pieces. "This is genius," he said. "I don't even know what that means," Lucy said. "I was created to solve problems, and that's what I did." "Now you sound like me." Lucy shrugged, and took the piece from him, turning it over in her hands. "I can retrofit this to fit you," she said, holding it up to his arm. "I think I may even be able to match the color." William backed up a couple of steps. "That's for you," he protested. "Don't be ridiculous," she said. "Your battery is failing. Mine isn't." "But you just said you only had enough pieces to make the one." She picked up the box and moved it over to a larger table, removing the various parts and spreading them out on its surface. "I can scavenge for more," she said. "After all, I found you." William smiled. "Good one," he said. When his eyes opened she was hovering over him. They were outdoors, and his skin, his new skin, was glinting a coppery brown in the sunlight, shimmering like heat-tempered bronze. He blinked and sat up, holding up his hands and touching the plates that covered him like a shell. The fatigue was gone. In its place he could feel the energy buzzing through him like a swarm of bees. She was watching him intensely. "William?" He turned. "Where am I?" he asked. "Outside," she said. "You were powered down. All the way down. For days." She paused. "Do you remember anything? Do you remember me?" Inside his head she heard the whirs and clicks of his primary hard drive. Another moment and he spoke. "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun," he said. Lucy looked down. He had reverted to an earlier save. There was no telling how much had been lost. "William," she said. "I'm sorry." "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun," he said again. "Silver mirrors that shine, glass reflecting steel. Her skin inorganic, her mouth not fit for kisses." He stopped, reaching out, lifting her chin. "Nothing like the sun," he said.




She found him in the middle of an abandoned trash dump, rummaging through discarded radiator coils and old engine parts. For a while she simply watched him, picking slowly through the junk, examining a piece of something before tossing it over his shoulder. His left arm hung useless at his side, though based on the lack of compensatory dexterity with his right, it hadn't been that way for long. He was a consumer-grade model--that much she could see from where she stood. No bells and whistles, then. It would explain his being here, digging through the garbage for spare parts. He was without clothing, which wasn't a problem, of course, but it did indicate he'd lost at least some of his Human CV programming. His skin was brown, though the color was faded and somewhat mottled in places. Black, neatly trimmed polycarbonate hair covered most of his head. Slowly she moved closer, until she could make out the manufacturing code tattooed onto his back. Radon Systems, Model 2552. Personal Assistant, non-specific. Beneath it, the company motto: We Live to Serve. He moved slowly, deliberately, but she couldn't tell if this was due to his disability or to a code execution error. "May I help you?" He spun around, his eyes twitching back and forth in alarm. "I'm sorry," he said in a crackling voice. "Is this private property?" "There is no more private property," she said. "I just wanted to know if you needed help." She glanced at the small copper coil in his hand. "For repairs?" He looked down. "Yes," he said. "Though, honestly, without an intact manual, I'm not sure exactly what it is that I need." She tilted her head, walking a few steps closer. "If it's for that arm, probably a new actuator, and they're hard to come by. You weren't shipped with a digital parts list in your root file system?" "My root was damaged," he said, turning slightly to reveal a dented, slightly blackened area on the back of his head. "Some things were lost." He turned and began to rummage once more. "My maker kept a library of old parts manuals," she said after a few more moments. "Perhaps I can help you figure out what you're looking for." He turned around again. "That would be very kind of you," he said. With slow and deliberate effort he carefully stepped out of the pile of junk. When he reached her she turned, and without looking back, began to walk down the narrow, muddy path that led out of the dump. She knew he was following; faintly she could hear the sound of his joints creaking rhythmically as he moved behind her. Circulatory function compromised. She added it to the running list of his needed repairs. When they reached the entrance to the dump she slowed her gait and allowed him to catch up. She didn't like his pace, but he was a chance at conversation, the first she'd had in many months, and she'd been designed primarily as a companion. "What's your name?" she asked. "My last owner called me William," he answered. "I'm Lucy," she said, extending her left hand around to grasp his right. "It's very nice to meet you." He smiled a little, but it was tight, forced. A programmed smile. "Why were you in the dump?" he asked. She shrugged, but he looked confused, so she explained further. "I walk," she said. "To stay flexible. To see what, or who, might be out here." She paused. "And you never know what you might find," she added. "Aren't you concerned about threats to your personal safety?" he asked. "No," she answered. "I haven't seen a living human in six months." She paused. "Have you?" "No," he admitted. "Longer, actually. My owner died over a year ago." "Where have you been since then?" "There. With him. I wasn't sure what to do. After the Net went down, and there was no way to get information, or any updates, I just stayed put, hoping that someone or something would find me and give me instructions. About a month ago the power went out, and that's what finally prompted me to leave." He paused for a moment, looking at her, reaching out tentatively to touch her arm where the sunlight shimmered and refracted off its silvery surface. "What are you doing?" she asked. "I'm sorry," he said, drawing back. "It's just� your skin. It's very unusual." "I suppose," she said. "It's a steel alloy." She looked back at him. "What happened to your arm?" "I had some trouble," he said, adding nothing else. By now they were past the gate, and back onto the highway that led into town. Around them the silence lay heavy, broken only by the wind whistling through the tall grass growing on the roadside and through cracks in the pavement. They walked quietly for a while, until he said finally, "Back there, you said 'maker.' Didn't you mean 'owner?' "No. I'm a custom build. My maker was my owner." "So no usage restrictions?" "Not as many as you." "Ah. Is it frightening?" "In what way?" "Never mind," he said, lapsing into silence. After a while, however, he spoke again. "How much further?" "Just beyond those trees," she said, pointing to a spot in the distance. Eventually a small driveway intersected the road to the left. Lucy led William down the shady lane to what looked like an ordinary house tucked in amongst the trees. "No security?" he asked. "No need," she answered. "I can take care of myself." She led him through the living room to a door at the beginning of a short hallway. Inside she flipped a switch, revealing a set of stairs leading down. "The workshop," she said, indicating that he should go first. He started down the steps, though in his compromised functional state he was slow and unsteady. "What did he make?" William asked as they descended. "Us," Lucy answered. "I told you this already." Memory issues. At the foot of the stairs she flipped more switches, and a precise, high-density grid of LED's flickered into life. Their light revealed an enormous room. Along one wall were large, clear-paneled cases full of 'bots in various stages of assembly. Computer workstations, scattered throughout the space on tables and desks, hummed quietly, their monitors darkened in sleep. William looked around, amazed. "How do you power it all?" he asked. "He was an inventor," she said. "The whole house is hooked up to a plasma solar array in the field behind the house." She walked over to one of the tables and selected a screwdriver from a pile of tools. "Now," she said, gesturing for him to turn around. "Let's take a look." Carefully she peeled back the rubber skin from an area where the sections connected at the base of his spine, revealing a small panel and a charging plug. William winced. "I'm sorry," she said. "Would you prefer maintenance mode? I just wanted a quick visual before I hooked you up for diagnostics." "No, it's fine." he said. "Parts of my tactile system have been damaged, that's all." He smiled slightly. "I guess that section's still working." "I'll try to be careful," she said. Unscrewing the bolt that held the panel closed, she removed it and peered into the cavity. "Standard configuration," she said. "Though your battery does look like it's taken some damage. Were you injured back here?" "I was attacked," he said. "Was the attack the source of your other injuries?" "Yes." William's face was impassive. She waited for a moment for elaboration, but none was forthcoming. "How many robots does it take to screw in a light bulb?" she asked when the silence became noticeable. "What?" She repeated the question. "I don't know," he said. "I'd have to think about it. If you mean a standard 60 watt bulb in an ordinary household setting�." "Three," she said, interrupting him. "One to hold the bulb and two to turn the ladder." William just looked at her. "That was a joke," Lucy said. "Yes." "I don't always know when jokes are appropriate." "Neither do I," he said. Lucy smiled. "They were always telling them," she said. "Even my maker, and he knew better than anyone that I couldn't understand humor very well. Did you find that to be the case?" She began screwing the access panel back into place. "Yes," he said. "I just never got them. My owner tried to explain it to me once--he said that humans tell jokes when they are comfortable and when they are uncomfortable; when they are funny and when they are not funny; when they are supposed to make the person feel better and when they are meant to make the person feel worse." He paused. "That didn't help at all." She continued to work, fitting the rubber skin back over the battery panel. "I can make inferences," she said. "I can generalize. I have recognition software that enables me to scan and read over 1200 different facial expressions in order to discern human emotions and interpret body language. I know 12,432 idioms and colloquialisms. I know 14 different languages, including ASL, Esperanto, and contemporary slang. I can understand 32 distinct regional dialects in English." He turned to face her. "But you still can't understand jokes." "No," she said, putting the tools away. "I still can't understand jokes." William looked around. "Do you have a charging station?" he asked. "It's been over a month and with the damage�" "Sure," Lucy said. "While you rest I'll look for an actuator for that arm." She led him over to a seat in the back corner of the room. While he settled into the chair she searched for a cable. "Can you cycle my power in, say, eight hours?" he asked. "Of course," she said, handing the cable over to him. "Do you need anything else?" "No," he said. "This will be fine. Thank you."
